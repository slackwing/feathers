## L Diagrams

I think it'll be a waste of time trying to explain what these are, since I don't even know yet.

### Anxious, Insufferable Tenacity

- K's mother called back. 2nd or 3rd time since the argument.
- She feels something's still not addressed. She broods until she can't help herself.

### A Thing Said Mainly to be Said, and With Good or Null Intention, not Perceiving its Harm

- B explains that sometimes partners in an endeavor have incompatible visions, and that one simply wants to "boot" the other out of the project. He has said this at least once before tonight, each time causing me to {verb}.
- _TODO_

### Thoughts

- Emotions are the shadows of lower-level facts about the world.
- Elusiveness of a fact contributes to fear (of non-communicatability), which manifests different strategies according to personality.
- What I call "fact" is a "subjective fact," which seems like an oxymoron, but it's my belief that we almost always think in terms of facts, not "maybes." Even when we don't consider something an "objective fact," we put ourselves in a subjunctive world supposing it _were_. I'd like to take the risk of calling all thoughts "facts" for the possible benefit of drawing discussions closer to the way we truly think.
