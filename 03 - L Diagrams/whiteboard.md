### Thoughts

- Emotions are the shadows of lower-level facts about the world.
- Elusiveness of a fact contributes to fear (of non-communicatability), which manifests different strategies according to personality.
- What I call "fact" is a "subjective fact," which seems like an oxymoron, but it's my belief that we think in terms of "facts," not "maybes." Even when we don't consider something an "objective fact," we put ourselves in a subjunctive world—"Suppose it _were_ so..."—in which it _is_ an "objective fact."
