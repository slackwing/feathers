### Context

Sooner or later, experienced developers find themselves carrying a toolkit from job to job, even job to home. This toolkit might contain: favorite shell configs, aliases, color schemes, keymappings, and so on. They may have also developed some sort of "launcher" that quickly opens up logs, dashboards, and frequently accessed pages and documents, in 2-3 keystrokes. Some go as far as integrating mouse / keyboard automations, even pixel-scanning to help those automations.

I've personally known several such developers (VM, AP, TB, EO) besides myself, and having listened to their process and demonstration, I'm certain about one thing: **Toolkits cannot be shared**.
