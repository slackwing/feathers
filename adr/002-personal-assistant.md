### Context

Sooner or later, experienced developers find themselves carrying a toolkit from job to job, even job to home. This toolkit might contain: favorite shell configs, aliases, color schemes, keymappings, and so on. They may have also developed some sort of "launcher" that quickly opens up logs, dashboards, and frequently accessed pages and documents in just a few keystrokes. Finally, some go as far as having integrated mouse / keyboard automations, even pixel-scanning to help those automations.

I've personally known several such developers (VM, AP, TB, EO), and learned a bit about their toolkits. The most important thing I've learned from them and my own experiences is:

**Your toolkit is for _you_, and you only.**
