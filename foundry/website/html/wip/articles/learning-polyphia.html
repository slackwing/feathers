# Metatechniques for Guitar Practice

[WIP: Introduction]

### When you can play a rapid succession of notes evenly at a slower tempo, but it breaks down as you increase the tempo.

Do _not_ begin with the metronome. The overwhelmingly predominant advice here, is to start slow and gradually build up. But let me tell you something about **advice** in general.

Firstly, **people who suffered to achieve often cannot help but insist the suffering was necessary.** They _are_ right sometimes, but you should not just assume so without exploring other options. Consider this: The metronome method will commit you to tens of hours of blind practiceâ€”and that's bad enough, but worseâ€”there's a chance it will erode your spirit and extinguish your curiosity. That's game over. Surely you can spare an hour considering alternatives.

Secondly, I'm not saying the metronome method doesn't work. I'm saying it may not be the _only way_. **Advice is multi-dimensional.** Popular advice tends to be advice that works for the most number of people. But people and their situations vary wildly. So it can only be the case that _more specific advice exists_, but the details and edges have been sanded down to fit more people and more situations. Okay, but where to find the specific advice? ðŸ¤· You may have thought that I'm against popular advice, but on the contrary: The strength of popular advice is its accessibility. Some popular advice will always turn out to be misconceptions of course. But the rest exist because they _do_ work and have withstood the test of time _and can be communicated easily_. I believe the metronome method is one of them. But back to finding the specific advice: **The _specific_ adviceâ€”the advice _tailored_ and therefore most powerful to the person seeking that adviceâ€”is behind lock and key.**

Several locks and keys.

1. **A teacher.** TODO

1. **Physical introspection.** TODO, (very different from mental introspection).

1. **Process introspection.** TODO, _e.g._ Congratulations: If you're reading this article, then you are practicing process introspection.

1. **Mental stamina.** TODO

1. **Memory or mental aids.** TODO

1. **Feedback loop.** TODO, _e.g._ recording.

- "establishing", how a teacher can notice and point that out
- "pre-shaping" (chords), how a teacher can help: identifying the chords that can make your hand more flexible in the specific way you need it to be
- "initial state", you are playing the part over and over but the state of your hands do not match the state you come in from from the previous party, how a teacher can notice that and point it out

Accessible advice is a strength, but
