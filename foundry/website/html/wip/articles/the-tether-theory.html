<!-- I remember my friend Taylor once saying, _"Humans are **not** special."_ We were wondering what particular aspect of human observation (if any) was the one messing with quantum outcomes. His was a viewpoint I simultaneously shared and wondered how to break. (I wonder now, in classic psychoanalytic fashion, if this stance, this steadfastness against mysticism, while appearing rational, was in fact something deeply personal wearing a mask of impersonality. Who stood to gain from

gravity, electromagnetic, all conspire with the principle of least action

, impartial to life, atheistic toward the human conscious—was, in fact, something deeply personal wearing a mask of impersonality.)

born of principles higher than and untainted by the imperfections of our consciousness, this agnostic, _impersonal_  was, in fact, a deeply personal kind of impersonality.

### 1. The grand amplifier

<span style="color:red">**The Tether Theory (T3)** is an idea about why humans _are_ special, such that human observation can influence quantum effects.</span> It presupposes, as many theories have, that there exists at least one **additional time dimension**—which might be understood in the popular way of "multiple timelines" or "parallel universes"—as well as particles that move along that dimension, _i.e._ crossing timelines or universes. Consequently, cause and effect tie together not only past with future, but _many_ pasts with _many_ futures. There's nothing particularly novel up to this point.

T3's main proposal however, is that **human brains** are an unprecedented object in the universe, capable of _observing_ literally a single one of the tiniest possible events in the universe, _e.g._ _what a photon did_, and as a result potentially putting into motion a headswimmingly vast chain of events. Say at first it's a handful of scientists conversing, writing, and publishing—imagine the vibrating vocal chords, muscles contracting to make gestures of the face and hands, coffee brewing at 367K and dripping one night in service of a final draft, fingers pressing thousands of keys. Say then the findings find their way to scientific news—pulses of electricity and light cross transoceanic cables and fan out to data centers around the world as millions of smartphones pull the latest feed, _each_ emitting _10 quadrillion photons_ per second at specific wavelengths to shine out the letters of the headline, which at least thousands of scientists and enthusiasts pause to read, to think about _what that one photon did_. Say, finally, the discovery is groundbreaking—then over the next decade, new research alters the lifecourse of those who get involved—where they'll live and for how many years—and therefore the lifecourse of their families; new experiments call for construction and transport of new equipment; new editions of textbooks print, new lectures are given, new YouTube content is produced, and new ideas enter the minds of a new generation of scientists. When in the history of the universe has a _single_ particle been able to influence the motion of _countless_—I unseriously estimate at somewhere between $10^{30}$ and $10^{50}$—particles? All made possible by an object—some 1,300 cubic centimeters in size—a grand amplifier of events—the human brain.

But we have to qualify some of what we've said. **First, resulting events are not always unique to a single cause**. The coffee may brew that night regardless, the phone screen emits just as many photons for a different headline, and new editions of textbooks are due anyway. **Second, resulting events are not forever _divergent_.** The commuter who took a minute to ponder the headline yet catches the same train, in year 3024 it does not matter* whether this discovery was made in the US in 2024 or Finland in 2026 (and via observing different photons), and life on Earth in all timelines will likely end. Actually these two points are one and the same, just presented from different angles. The first is saying that a _common present_ is possible through _multiple pasts_. The second is saying that _multiple presents_ can become a _common future_. In other words, **timelines converge**.

Really try to visualize this: Standing at the point where they converge, one looks back to see timelines like tendrils, disappearing into the horizon, tethering a multitude of pasts to this moment. One way or another, all those timelines had to play out in such a way that they coincide here, now. But imagine 60 seconds before the coincision—the timelines are not all quite aligned, but close. 30 seconds before—the timelines are getting even closer to one another. Imagine 15 seconds, 5 seconds, 1 second—the timelines are becoming so similar that if you were to "jump" from one timeline to its adjacent, you might not even notice a difference. Imagine a millisecond, a microsecond, a nanosecond—you could travel _through_ timelines, _i.e._ cruising from timeline to timeline, yet feel no "glitch"—it's smooth—it's _continuous_. **T3 presupposes continuity in all dimensions.** Between any timeline and another, there is an infinite number of timelines that gradually morph one timeline's circumstances to the other's—it's really a _gradient_ of parallel universes. This is key to understanding T3.

<span style="color:red">So finally, we can express T3's connection between the human brain and quantum effects. We'll take the most famous experiment in quantum physics—Young's double slit experiment—and its counterintuitive results, and show how T3 makes them make perfect sense.</span>

### 2. The uncommonly told story of diffraction

Look at this top-down view of water waves passing through a slit in a wall:

[[Classical animation of parallel water waves, a single slit, and circular wavefronts.]]

This classic animation is used as an analogy to teach about **light**. But from the very beginning it hijacks our intuition to make sense of things that we should be questioning. For example, why shouldn't it look like this?

[[Same as above except only a narrow line of waves extends from the slit to the backwall.]]

Some of us have spent enough time at the beach, maybe even remember water hitting breakwalls or atolls, to _know_ that water doesn't behave this way. The rest of us might also agree, on (valid) intuition. But the problem with intuition, as we're going to see, is that when we zoom in seeking more precise answers, we'll discover we're already seeing the picture at its highest resolution. Straining our eyes won't coax new details to appear. Sooner or later we'll have to give up and look for the source, elsewhere—a concrete, rather than intuitive, understanding.

Since we know that's our destination, we cut straight there. We'll begin with an example we can relate to, before we go into the molecular and subatomic levels. [TODO]

 1. First, **waves themselves don't exist materially**. Take for example, "the wave" at sports stadiums:

    [[=20240803-the-wave.gif:360]]

    Though we clearly see "a wave," in reality it's individuals moving their limbs up and down. No real, material thing is actually moving across the stadium.

 1. However, the individuals _are_ linked by some sort of interaction with one another. In the stadium example, it's individuals seeing or anticipating the neighbors to their left standing up, to begin standing up themselves. We will call this interaction, the wave's **<u>underlying mechanism</u>**. Note that this mechanism is _real_—is _material_. What we're saying is _not_ real, and _not_ material, is individuals here jumping to their right like soccer goalies.

 1. Finally though, **things that are not "real" or "material" can yet still have <u>properties</u>**. In the stadium example, we can _measure_ the wave's velocity (maybe about as fast as an Olympic sprinter), and average thickness (eyeballing it, about 15 people shoulder-to-shoulder).

Let's apply these to water.

First, waves you see traveling toward the beach are _not_ water molecules themselves traveling toward the beach. Quite like the stadium wave, those water molecules are actually just moving up and down. Some interaction—some _underlying mechanism_—causes one row of water molecules to follow their neighboring row of water molecules, moving up just after their neighbor does, moving down just after their neighbor does.

[[Animated cross-section of water molecules moving up and down. Many examples online but fit one to style.]]

The underlying mechanism in this case is **pressure**.

[...]

Simply put: Pressure moves in all directions. It is a jostling of ...





Maybe now show a real clip of z





 **an <u>interaction</u> between similar, neighboring <u>things</u>** is what enables a wave to "move." In the stadium example, the "things" are people, and the


new outline
1. the underlying mechanism, the jostling, pushes in all directions; that's why the waves spread in concentric circles, and not narrow channel
1. light through a door, why doesn't it create a banded pattern? -> the explanation is wavelength-to-aperture ratio, but no, it's zoom <-- imagine water waves through the doorway
other
- is fraunhofer zone just... parallel at a distance?


outline
1. light through a wide slit (e.g. doorway)
1. light through an (extremely) narrow slit, like water waves
1. there is so much easily taken for granted. when you looked at the image above, did you question, "why does water do that?" or did you just accept it because it intuitively made sense? from our life experience, it makes sense.
1. the reason it happens with water is that, if you imagine a body of water particles, they are in a way interconnected; they're not all moving in 1 or even 2 or 3 directions; they jumble in all kinds of directions, and this jumbling spreads out; but when zoomed out so far you just don't see this jumbling reach very far "out" even though it's there; so in other words, it's not so much a relationship between the slit width and the wavelength (such dense terms), it's a matter of zoom; we will zoom in so incredibly much that we can see the jostling spread laterally
1. so now imagine an up-and-down motion; before the slits it looks lateral but that's because it's set up that way to make a point; if we were to zoom out to the edges, the artificial linearness would break down and become rounded too; but the artificialness is created in order to prevent the reader from thinking that previous roundness is what is causing the subsequent roundness; so anyway this up-and-down motion spreads through the slit...
1. [maybe start from a simplified drawing; then in layers add the "reality" like fading out and stuff, but then come back to the simplified]
1. show how single-slit creates wiiiide patterns, there's some drawings/gifs that do this better
1. then double-slit
1. where to insert bullets? so... it's actually not the particleness that prevents banding; in fact bullets would band too; no; okay show how if it bounces off the slit wall, it's still very limited if we put the gun far away

don't forget
1. mention to longevity of information thanks to humans

Imagine shooting bullets at 2 slits in a wall, and observing the pattern made against a wall further back.

![](../shared/assets/20240514-bullets.jpeg)

When light was thought to be _particles_—_i.e._ tiny bullets named **photons**—the same pattern above was expected to be seen if one were to shine a laser through 2 slits. But instead, this is what is actually seen:

![](../shared/assets/20240514-photons.jpeg)

This evidenced that light _also_ sometimes behaves as _waves_ (as opposed to particles). To explain, the **banded pattern** above is a known result of 2 properties unique to waves, _e.g._ water waves:

![](../shared/assets/20240514-water.jpeg)

The first of these properties is **diffraction**—when waves pass through a slit, they appear to come out the other end in concentric circles called **wavefronts**. The second is **interference**—when wavefronts pass through each other, coinciding peaks create taller peaks, coinciding troughs create deeper troughs, and where peaks meet troughs, they cancel out as if the water were flat. This is decidedly not how particles (bullets) behave—they don't combine into bigger bullets nor do they disappear.

The troubling thing was, other experiments clearly showed light being particles—photons. Was light somehow _both_?

A simple tweak to the experiment reveals an even greater mystery. We now lower the intensity of the light source (the laser)—make it so faint that in its sporadic emission of photons, only 1 makes it through a slit every 2-3 minutes—we can tell through a detector in the backwall that picks up on any photon hitting it. If we let this experiment run for 24 hours, about 500 photons will have made it to the backwall. When we look at where they all landed the next day, we expect to see 2 lines—the bullet pattern—because only 1 photon traveled at a time—presumably it goes through 1 of the slits—

ah fuck wrong because.
single slit also gives banded


w journeys alone through the slits, there can be no interaction—no adding up or canceling out—right? Wrong, apparently! After letting the experiment run for 24 hours, which allowed around 500 photons to get through, we overlay the 500 snapshots taken by the detector (the "white wall") to produce an image, and we yet see the banded pattern! How? A typical interpretation is that the photon has somehow interacted with _itself_—somehow gone through _both_ slits. (T3 has an alternative explanation.) **Scenario 3.** Well, why don't we confirm that. We can add a detector at each slit to record _which way_ a photon passes through—left or right (or both)—otherwise keeping the experiment identical. We run the experiment for another 24 hours, now producing a time-series chart where every 2-3 minutes we see a blip indicating left or right. At the end of it however, we see that photons always went left or right, never both, confounding the self-interacting interpretation. But wait. Something strange has happened with the resulting image. The banded pattern has disappeared!



(And no, it's not due to the detection mechanism, though a good guess.)

### An outline that makes sense specifically to me.

  1. Consider time a 4th spatial dimension $t$, however popularly misunderstood or naive. I'd like breach this topic using popular metaphors and illustrations then shed the superficial pieces later, after forming useful intuitions.
  1. Imagine there being a 5th spatial dimension $u$ as well.
  1. In order to be able to use 3-dimensional visualizations to discuss a 4th and 5th dimensions, let's "make room" by replacing our most familiar dimensions $x$, $y$, $z$ with a 1-dimensional proxy, $s$. This means displacement in $s$—albeit restricted to a line—reflects displacement in $(x, y, z)$. [Image]
  1. It's easy then to imagine that a path in $(s, t)$ reflects movement in time $(x, y, z, t)$. [Image]
  1. Now let depth represent yet another dimension, $u$. And consider a set of $(s, t)$ paths that are parallel to one another. One may import the popularized notion of "parallel timelines" here, if only to anchor on a familiar concept before we continue into the abstract. [Image]
      - The way nature (on our scale) appears always to be continuous. [Ocean waves, etc.] Take an ideal form such as a square. Zoom in on a corner. In nature, it eventually appears to be a rounded corner. Sharp discontinuities are our own invention.
  1. What is between these paths? We imagine $(s, t, u)$ being continuous. [Image]
  1. This opens up the possibility of paths traveling _across_ $u$—or "between timelines". Let's bring into focus _what_ is traveling so it's easier to imagine—let's say it's a particle.

### Main outline and ideas.

  1. **Present the unsettling mystery of the double-slit experiment.** (Check with Vedant and maybe Physics SO or Meta or Chat later.) To the atheistic scientistic type, it offends the senses to suggest that humans are somehow "special." (Show an animal—no collapse.) [State this as a fact. Maybe disclaim in endnotes. I mean, if it turns out to be false, then it doesn't matter, all this was fiction.]
  1. [Leave until nearly finished.] **A summary of the proposal.** The collapsing of alternate paths into one decided future; reverse-propagating to the present like tethers.
  1.

### Musings.

  1. Where does "possibility" even come from? One idea: Imagine 2 particles colliding at _exactly_ 90 degrees. I think there's ambiguity here, as to which particle would go "left" or "right" versus the other. Could that ambiguity be at the heart of possibilities? In fact, maybe the particles don't _have_ to leave at 90 degrees—maybe all directions in 3-space is possible. Either one particle's trajectory determines the other, or the second particle still has a degree of freedom. Let me run with the former. Then the potential trajectories out can be captured by $\theta$ and $\phi$.
  1. A planet has a future that is quite difficult to change. And so its tethers drag with it everything in its vicinity, like us. And that "dragging" is what we experience as gravity. From a higher dimension, the dragging (in the static frame) is simply: Continuity.

### Format and organization ideas.

  1. Maybe write in the introduction that I'm writing this for Abi. I only need to be understood by one person.
  1. Might have to find a novel way to really quickly prop up the spacetime analogy, _e.g._ look at illusions such as this and this [3D looking art that turns out to be 2D when the camera is moved, Rene Magritte, the concave sculpture of a head whose gaze follows you, ...]

### Ideas to wave in later.

  1. The influence of belief (_e.g._ prayer) in "constraining the lattice," first thought of after reading [this Psychology Today article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotional-behavior-behavioral-emotions/202401/how-time-perception-influences-physical-healing).
  1. So strange, like we've been groping in the dark and feeling the truth but unable to see. Interstellar's _love_ as a force—love is truly a strong, long-term tether for humans, no? And remember the year when the concept of dropping into an alternate timeline got really popular? (What might cause this? It's almost like... _un_-tethering...)
  1. Could perhaps an alternate test of AGI be, having the (supposed) AGI observe the double-slit experiment?
