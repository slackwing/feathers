<h2>December 18, 2023</h2>

**Monday.** _"Take your credit and sit down!"_ ü§£

Yesterday, we quickly found that no solution exists for 
$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix*}[r]50\\% \\\\ 100\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&=\alpha_u\begin{bmatrix*}[r]100\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&&+\alpha_d\begin{bmatrix*}[r]0\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}
\end{alignat}$$

Next we wondered how (and why) the complex domain and representing probabilities as their square roots might help. First let's rewrite the percentages as decimals‚Äîthis is the same equation that has no solution:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}&=\alpha_u\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ \frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}&&+\alpha_d\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ \frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

Here's a fleeting but key idea, I think: In _QMTTM_, $\ket{r}$ alone doesn't contain the entire situationship. Multiplying it with $\bra{u}$ eliminates the $\alpha_d$ term and leaves $\alpha_u$, which _wholly_ and _only_ contains the probability amplitude. Contrast that to our setup, where $\ket{r}$ contains the entire situationship by itself, and the $\alpha$ coefficients serve to massage $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$'s situationships into $\ket{r}$'s.

So I wonder two things. (1) Was there even a valid rationale behind setting up a linear equation of the same form, when the nature of the ket vectors were completely different? (2) If we entertain that possibility, then have we "transferred" probability information from the coefficients to the ket vectors? (Then what information do the coefficients represent?)

<h2>December 17, 2023</h2>

**Sunday.** Later today we're going to Hey Yuet for Kaz's birthday. // Back and continuing. Abi's watching Game of Thrones on the couch.

I want to outline where I'm headed next with this article:

1. Introduce the bra-ket notation using $\braket{u|r}$.
1. Restate that $\braket{u|r}$ is 50-50.
1. State that $\braket{d|r}$ is equivalent, though swapped.
1. Extend to $\braket{o|r}$ and $\braket{i|r}$.
1. Extend to $\braket{r|r}$ and $\braket{l|r}$.
1. Point out redundance of the probability of $-1$. ùíú can only measure $+1$ or $-1$ so there's no situation where you'd find probabilities not summing to 100%.
1. Assert $\ket{r}$'s set of probabilities as its **situationship**‚Äîthe property we've been looking for‚Äîtemporaneously notated $\\{50\\%, 50\\%, 100\\%, 0\\%, 50\\%, 50\\%\\}$‚Äîthen write out all 6 situations' situationships.
1. Point out redundance of considering $\braket{d|r}$, $\braket{i|r}$, and $\braket{l|r}$, compacting the notation to $\\{50\\%, 100\\%, 50\\%\\}$, etc. for all 6 situations' situationships.
1. Then we can consider the algebra:
$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\ket{r}&=\alpha_u\ket{u}&&+\alpha_d\ket{d}\\\\
\\{50\\%, 100\\%, 50\\%\\}&=\alpha_u\\{100\\%, 50\\%, 50\\%\\}&&+\alpha_d\\{0\\%, 50\\%, 50\\%\\}
\end{alignat}$$

Great. Now I can look ahead exploratively, before spending time writing up all of the above. Suppose we interpreted situationships as column vectors:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix*}[r]50\\% \\\\ 100\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&=\alpha_u\begin{bmatrix*}[r]100\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&&+\alpha_d\begin{bmatrix*}[r]0\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}
\end{alignat}$$

That would force $\alpha_u=\frac{1}{2}$ but then $\alpha_d$ must be $\frac{3}{2}$ to satisfy the middle row or also $\frac{1}{2}$ to satisfy the bottom row. So there appears to be no solution.

Let's be creative though. How might the complex domain help? How might representing probabilities as their square roots help? The two have to work together‚Äîthe squaring of a complex number is where its power lies.

**Sunday.** Impenetrable grey.

Where was I headed, that it seemed advantageous to define a "situationship" as a set of probabilities of measuring in all directions, rather than just one? ... Ah right‚ÄîI was aiming to show that 2 probabilities were sufficient‚Äîand that those probabilities might as well be the ones associated with $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$. But how could I not have noticed such a glaring error? It's not an attribute of $\braket{r|u}$ that's a situationship; it's $\ket{u}$. So:

$$\ket{u}=\\{50\\%, 50\\%, 100\\%\\}$$

<h2>December 4, 2023</h2>

**Monday.** Spotify laid off over 1,500 of us. I can't think about physics.

<h2>December 2 & 3, 2023</h2>

**Saturday.** Just getting home from shooting a music video. It was more demanding than I expected‚Äî7 back-to-back takes with a short break in the middle. But it also went smoother than I expected, with Vlad's prep and experience and everyone in the band showing up early and being helpful. **Sunday.** Can't move my neck this morning.

21 days ago, we formulated the following question:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>Given the symbols $\ket{u}$, $\ket{d}$, $\ket{r}$, $\ket{l}$, $\ket{o}$, $\ket{i}$ to represent <em>situations</em> (an orientation <em>and</em> measurement in a particular direction), and the symbols $\bra{u}$, $\bra{d}$, $\bra{r}$, $\bra{l}$, $\bra{o}$, $\bra{i}$ to mean a re-orientation in a particular direction (<em>without</em> measurement), can we invent an algebra in which these symbols can be treated as quantities (being addable, multipliable, etc.), and in which the multiplication of $\bra{y}\times\ket{x}$ not only represents the <em>situationship</em> $\braket{y|x}$ but conveniently <em>computes</em> to the probability of the situationship in that particular direction?</p>
</div>

But I think it could use some more clarification. The "quantities" are of an unknown kind‚Äîan unknown _dimension_. We ourselves assert that the dimensionality of $\braket{x|y}$ is a probability (or some function thereof)‚Äîthe probability of reading $\ket{x}$ in the next measurement. It almost seems like a neat trick that by that definition and experimentally, we know that $\braket{x|x}=1$ and $\braket{x|\bar{x}}=0$.

But why did we bring up the concept of multivalued functions? Right‚Äîwe wondered if they were being used as a mechanism to allow 2 distinct situations to share the same situationship, _i.e._ both $\braket{u|r}$ and $\braket{u|o}$ compute to a 50% probability of measuring $\ket{u}$, but are different situations.

We found though that we could not recreate a working setup with the absolute value function over the real domain. When we tried with the squaring function over the complex domain, at first we also found 0 working setups. But in that attempt we had not used complex conjugates, which when introduced did lead to 2,048 working setups.

I think it's time to wrap up this arc. I had hoped to understand _why_ complex numbers, _why_ complex conjugation, _why_ probability "amplitudes," etc., but I feel I keep running into the doors of abstract algebra, which are locked and inaccessible to me at this time. I think I'm not ready to understand this part yet. And we haven't even gotten to generalizing the whole thing for arbitrary directions $\theta$ and $\phi$, which might even hold a clue about _why the squaring function_ (its relation to circles).

But here's a thing I kept wondering through this entire arc. _Had_ we been able to prove that no other multivalued function and algebraic setup could have met all the criteria and still produced a working setup, is that _why_ things are the way they are? I mean: Do we live in a universe that works this way _because_ no other physical setup is possible, because physical setups are a subset of algebraic setups, and we'd (hypothetically) found only one algebraic setup that works?

<h2>November 29 & 30, 2023</h2>

**Thursday.** Abi took me to Fausto for my birthday. The lighting was exactly as dim as I prefer, it was easy to talk, and the bartender concocted something bespoke based on my usual criteria‚ÄîMezcal and citrus in a highball‚Äîit was üëå. **Friday.** It's 6am now, and a rare type of dawn. There's just a thin strip of smokey red and orange, rapidly shading into the dark blue of the night. And what look like impossibly bright fireflies in the horizon, aligned in an unnaturally curved line. (Planes landing at JFK.)

On Tuesday we stumbled upon **Pauli matrices** when we computed the spin operators for 1 of our 2,048 possibilities. Was it chance, or do all possibilities lead to Pauli matrices?

Excluding duplicates (ignoring ordering), there appear to be **4** distinct sets of "Pauli" matrices:

<pre><code class="language-mathematica">
getSpinOperators[r_, l_, o_, i_] :=

  sxSolvedMatrix = ArrayReshape[sxSolved[[1, All, 2]], {2, 2}];

  {sxSolvedMatrix, sySolvedMatrix, szSolvedMatrix}
];

withoutDuplicates = DeleteDuplicates[
  getSpinOperators @@@ withoutScalarMultiples,
  (Sort[#]===Sort[#2])&

Print[TableForm@withoutDuplicates];

Here's the full <a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231130-mathematica">code</a>. The result, formatted:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\mathcal{P}_1 &= &&\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}&,\hspace{1em}&\begin{bmatrix}0 & -i \\\\ i & 0\end{bmatrix}&,\hspace{1em}\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\\\

\end{alignat}$$

$\mathcal{P}_1$ is the one used in QMTTM. My guess about there being 4 variants is that relative to a fixed up vs. down orientation on the z-axis, you can flip the x-axis, flip the y-axes, or flip both.

<h2>November 28, 2023</h2>

**Tuesday.** Met Amy and some coworkers at Metrorock Bushwick tonight. First time climbing in months‚Äîfelt unexpectedly nice.

We left off at discovering 2,048 possible sets of coefficients using the square root as our multivalued function. We didn't yet attempt to create spin operators for any of them. It's tedious to keep doing that by hand though, so let's write a program.

In a first pass, I expand out the system of linear equations, _i.e._ from

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
&\begin{bmatrix}xa & xb \\\\ xc & xd\end{bmatrix}\ket{r} &&= &\ket{r} \\\\
&\begin{bmatrix}xa & xb \\\\ xc & xd\end{bmatrix}\ket{l} &&= -&\ket{l}
\end{alignat}$$

to

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
xa\ket{r}_1 &+ xb\ket{r}_2 &&= &\ket{r}_1 \\\\
xc\ket{r}_1 &+ xd\ket{r}_2 &&= &\ket{r}_2 \\\\
xa\ket{l}_1 &+ xb\ket{l}_2 &&= -&\ket{l}_1 \\\\
xc\ket{l}_1 &+ xd\ket{l}_2 &&= -&\ket{l}_2 \\\\
\end{alignat}$$

and using `Solve`:

<pre><code class="language-mathematica">
sigmaX = Solve[
  xa * r[[1]] + xb * r[[2]] == r[[1]] &&
  xa * l[[1]] + xb * l[[2]] == -l[[1]] &&
  xc * r[[1]] + xd * r[[2]] == r[[2]] &&
  xc * l[[1]] + xd * l[[2]] == -l[[2]],
  Flatten[{{xa, xb}, {xc, xd}}]
]

(*
  {{xa -> 0, xb -> -I, xc -> I, xd -> 0}}
  {{ya -> 0, yb -> 1, yc -> 1, yd -> 0}}
*)
</code></pre>

In a second pass, I use the intended language for these purposes, _i.e._ matrices, vectors, and dot products:

<pre><code class="language-mathematica">
sx = {{sx11, sx12}, {sx21, sx22}};
sxSolved = Solve[sx.r == r && sx.l == -l, Flatten[sx]]

(* {{sx11 -> 0, sx12 -> -1, sx21 -> -1, sx22 -> 0}} *)

sxSolvedMatrix = ArrayReshape[sxSolved[[1, All, 2]], {2, 2}]

(* {{0, -1}, {-1, 0}} *)
</code></pre>

Finally, packaging the above into a function, we can compute the 3 spin operators‚Äî$\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, $\sigma_z$‚Äîfor just 1 of the 2,048 possibilities. The result:

<pre><code class="language-mathematica">{{{0, -I}, {I, 0}}, {{0, 1}, {1, 0}}, {{1, 0}, {0, -1}}}
</code></pre>

Formatted:

$$\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}0 & -i \\\\ i & 0\end{bmatrix}\hspace{2em}\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}\hspace{2em}\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}$$

Exactly the **Pauli matrices**! Was this chance or will all 2,048 possibilities reveal the same thing?

<h2>November 27, 2023</h2>

**Monday.** My band's playing The Bowery Electric in a few hours.

Today I'm just making some corrections to previous notes. I had been solving for

$$\begin{alignat}{1}
\sigma_x&\ket{r} &&= &&\ket{r} \\\\
\sigma_x&\ket{l} &&= -&&\ket{r}
\end{alignat}$$

instead of

$$\begin{alignat}{1}
\sigma_x&\ket{r} &&= &\ket{r} \\\\
\sigma_x&\ket{l} &&= -&\ket{l}
\end{alignat}$$

I don't really get the latter. Maybe it'll come to me later.<sup>*</sup>

<sup>* **Later.** Okay, I can see a little farther. We have to remember that the negative sign is an _eigenvalue_, $\lambda=-1$, and that the definition of an _eigenvector_ is a vector that produces _a scalar multiple of itself_. I guess though, still, I'm wondering why we set up these particular relations...</sup>

<h2>November 26, 2023</h2>

**Sunday.** Yesterday we watched _The Boy and the Heron_ at Angelika. It would have been overwhelming(ly confusing) had Abi not introduced me to _Paprika_ and _Howl's Moving Castle_ earlier this year. Maybe my interpretation is obvious and banal, but it moved me to think, _"The fantastic worlds our unconscious will construct and journey, to protect us from our deepest hurts."_

Before we explore other multivalued functions, I worry that my methodology behind concluding that the absolute value function cannot work, is flawed. One thing I can do to increase my confidence is to apply the same methodology to the square root function, which we know must work.

_Oh, right. This is my fantastic world._

So I wrote another program using the square root function. At first, I was disheartened to find it also outputted 0 possibilities‚Äîthe methodology must be flawed, I thought. But actually, the problem was that I was simply squaring the dot products of perpendicular situations, _e.g._ $\braket{o|u}^2$, whereas I needed to be multiplying by the complex conjugate, _e.g._ $\braket{o|u}\braket{u|o}$.

<a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231126-mathematica">_This_</a> opened up the number of possibilities to **2,048**!

It's actually fortunate that I made the simple squaring mistake. If I had gotten 2,048 possibilities on the first try, I would have questioned my methodology for a second reason. Recovering from 0 to 2,048 essentially showed me that the magic was in the complex conjugate.

<!-- Next, I think I need to stand back and review all that's happened so far. I need to evaluate whether I should explore a third multivalued function, or accept that a third or even fourth multivalued function will not elucidate for me, the reason squaring-with-complex-conjugates is the multivalued function that works. Perhaps the secret requires a certain amount of knowledge in **group theory** or the broader **abstract algebra**, which I don't have. -->

Yesterday we further narrowed our possible choices to 128. Let's pick one from this set and try again:

\ket{r}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em} 
&\ket{l}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ -\frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\ket{o}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em} 
&\ket{i}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix} 
\end{alignat}$$

We want to solve for $\sigma_x$:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ -\frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
-&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ -\frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

Wait, something's wrong with this one too.

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&+\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=&\frac{1}{2} \\\\
\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=&-\frac{i}{2} 
\end{alignat}$$

Multiply the second equation by $i$ to get:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&+\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=\frac{1}{2} \\\\
-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&-\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=\frac{1}{2} 
\end{alignat}$$

Then add the two equations:

$$0 = 1$$

$$\bot$$

No solution, once again. And I know why, and I'm an idiot. It wasn't just _duplicates_ and _negatives_ that were unsolvable. **_Any scalar multiples of one another_, including duplicates and negatives, were never going to work.** _That_ is the _real_ fourth criterion. A [Stack Overflow post](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/132348/6944) offers a way to detect that 2 vectors are scalar multiples of‚Äîor more concisely, _parallel_ to‚Äîone another. Updating the <a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231125-mathematica-2">code</a> to filter these out rather than just duplicates and negatives, the result?

**0 possibilities. There is no way to satisfy the four criteria using the absolute value function for our multivalued function.**

<h2>November 23 & 24, 2023</h2>

**Thursday.** Little Neck for Thanksgiving at my cousins'. We matched colors, pretended to be tourists at Grand Central, made the LIRR ticket inspector shuffle through 50 punched tickets because Abi wanted hers back as a souvenir (he was determined), and stopped to look at just about every tree and bush on the walk from the station to my uncle's. **Friday.** I'm remembering, we'd also passed through Douglaston, where we could see the Tudor-style house I lived in in 1996, visible from the train. Back then‚ÄîI was 8‚ÄîI never knew, never wondered where this train came from or went. It was just a recurring sound that drowned out our voices while we played dodgeball in the parking lot. In that cul-de-sac also was a small, first-floor office outfitted as a "computer school" where I went to learn how to type. And it was living in that house that one day we found something strange in our mail‚Äîa red CD with a picture of a hat on it. We didn't have a computer and no one knew what the CD was for, but I was allowed to keep it, like a shiny rock. In 1998‚ÄîI was 10‚Äîwe finally got a personal computer and I put the CD in, but was disappointed when nothing happened. It was many years later‚Äîby then the CD was lost, both physically and from my memory‚Äîthat I heard or read the words, _"Red Hat Linux"_. It's just crazy to think‚Äîsomeone in 1999 was going door to door dropping free CDs (which weren't cheap) in the mail, all in the name of open source software.

Anyway, last time we left off at discovering 288 possibilities of coefficients that pass [the three criteria](#20231116-criteria). Let's look at one of them:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{r}=&&\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{l}=&&-\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}-\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{o}=&&\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}-\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{i}=&&-\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}
\end{alignat}$$

I'm looking for a reason to invalidate that choice of coefficients, because I didn't expect the absolute value function to yield even 1 working possibility, let alone 288. Let's skip ahead to deriving **spin operators**. We rewrite the situations in column vector form:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\ket{r}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em} 
&\ket{l}&=\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\ket{o}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em} 
&\ket{i}&=\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} 
\end{alignat}$$

Let's start with $\ket{r}$ and $\ket{l}$. We want to solve for $\sigma_x$:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
-&\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

Take just the top rows:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&+\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&=\frac{1}{2} \\\\
-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&-\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&=\frac{1}{2} 
\end{alignat}$$

Summing these equations lead to:

$$0 = 1$$

$$\bot$$

It turns out we need a fourth criterion: $\ket{r}\ne-\ket{l}$ and $\ket{o}\ne-\ket{i}$, or else you end up with a degenerate<sup>1</sup> system that can't be solved. Adding this to the <a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231125-mathematica">code</a>, we are down to **128** possibilities.

<sup>1. I later realized "degenerate" might not be the correct term here.</sup>

<h2>November 19, 2023</h2>

Late **Sunday** night, sharing the desk and tea with Abi. She's creating an illustration for an editorial about hospital patients with excessive ER visits, and evaluating their housing situation as well as substance use or mental disorders so that social workers can get involved immediately, rather than defaulting to a diagnosis or operation the patients cannot afford. She's sketched some great ideas, like this one:

![](../shared/assets/Hospital_to_housing_01_B.png)

Anyway, on Friday we wanted to know: What are _all_ the alternate choices of coefficients for $\ket{l}$ that could lead to satisfying [the three criteria](#20231116-criteria)? I thought it'd be easier to just write a <a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231124-mathematica">program</a> that tries out all possibilities of coefficients for $\ket{r}$, $\ket{l}$, $\ket{o}$, and $\ket{i}$. Here's what it reveals:

1. Again, although there are infinite values in $\mathbb{C}$ whose absolute values are $\frac{1}{2}$ (the first criterion), for simplicity's sake, let's see if solutions exist that only use the values on the axes: \$\frac{1}{2}$, $-\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{i}{2}$, and $-\frac{i}{2}$. Combinatorically, this is choosing from 4 elements, 8 times (2 coefficients per situation), or 4<sup>8</sup>, which is **65,536** possibilities.

1. Of those, **4,096** pass the second criteria that $\braket{r|l}$ and $\braket{o|i}$ compute to zero.

1. Of those, **512** pass the third criteria that all "perpendicular" cases such as $\braket{r|o}$ and $\braket{r|i}$, including the cases involving $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$, compute to an absolute value of $\frac{1}{2}$.

1. Among those, I looked at some examples and noticed duplicates, _e.g._ $\ket{r}=\ket{l}=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}$. These pass the first criterion because of imaginary numbers multiplying to negatives. But they're clearly invalid since then those situations would be indistinguishable. Filtering them out, we're left with **288** possibilities.

I was quite surprised by this number. I was hoping for **0**‚Äîthat way I could say, _"And this is why the absolute value function cannot be the multivalued function that fits."_ But instead, now we'll have to go further to see where using the absolute value function breaks down experimentally, if it does at all.

<h2>November 17, 2023</h2>

**Friday.** At Amy's to help with a mouse problem; she's still somewhere in Europe.

The answer to yesterday's question is _no_‚Äîour particular formulation does _not_ meet "the third criteria," _i.e._ that $\braket{r|o}$ and $\braket{l|o}$ and $\braket{r|i}$ and $\braket{l|i}$ all yield 50% probabilities.

$$\begin{alignat}{5}
\braket{r|o}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{d|d}&&=\frac{i}{2}&\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\braket{l|o}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+(-\frac{1}{2})\frac{i}{2}\braket{d|d}&&=0&\not\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\braket{r|i}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+\frac{1}{2}(-\frac{i}{2})\braket{d|d}&&=\frac{i}{2}&\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\braket{l|i}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+(-\frac{1}{2})(-\frac{i}{2})\braket{d|d}&&=0&\not\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

What went wrong? It's simple. Algebraically,

$$\begin{alignedat}{3}
(\alpha\bra{u}+\alpha\bra{d})(\beta\ket{u}-\beta\ket{d})&=\alpha\beta\braket{u|u}&&-\alpha\beta\braket{u|d}\\\\
& &&+\alpha\beta\braket{d|u}-\alpha\beta\braket{d|d}\\\\
&=0
\end{alignedat}$$

Getting a zero this way was the desired effect for $\braket{r|l}$ and $\braket{o|i}$, but not for these perpendicular pairings. It's almost like programming now. What can we change so that for $\braket{l|o}$ and $\braket{l|i}$ the sign becomes positive but not for $\braket{l|u}$ and $\braket{l|d}$?

The choices are fewer than you'd think. In the classical style of proofs, let's make an assertion: Either $\ket{l}$ needs to change, or $\ket{o}$ and $\ket{i}$ need to change, or both. Right? They span the _entirety_ of options in our context.

Let's talk about $\ket{l}$ changing. Let's go all the way back to:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{r}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{l}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

What all could we even change $\ket{l}$ _to_? If we remain in the domain of complex numbers, the entirety of values that pass the "first criteria," _i.e._ their absolute values being $\frac{1}{2}$, _on_ the axes, are $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{i}{2}$, $-\frac{1}{2}$, and $-\frac{i}{2}$. (_Off_ the axes, all of the values on the continuous circle $\frac{1}{2}e^{i\theta}$ would pass. More on that later.)

<h2>November 15 & 16, 2023</h2>

**Wednesday.** Rehearsal felt strangely nice‚Äîin brief moments we spoke like friends. I expressed appreciation to Mark for backing me up on the root notes of the verse of _Can't You See_. He smiled. **Thursday.** No notes.

Let's continue where we left‚Äîseeing if we can find a suitable formula for $\ket{o}$ and $\ket{i}$ in terms of $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$, in the "absolute value world."

We can safely say we can't choose the same formulas that we did for $\ket{r}$ and $\ket{l}$. Neither $\ket{o}$ nor $\ket{i}$ should equal $\ket{r}$ or $\ket{l}$. And the following is not valid either:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{o}&=-\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{i}&=-\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

These are the same as $\ket{r}$ and $\ket{l}$, only looking at the world upside-down. What else can we possibly do to get coefficients with absolute values of $\frac{1}{2}$? Well, we can introduce complex numbers, _i.e._

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{o}&=\frac{i}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{i}&=\frac{i}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

<a name="20231116-criteria"></a>

This meets the first criteria: The absolute values of all these coefficients are $\frac{1}{2}$. It also meets the second criteria: $\braket{o|i}$ indeed computes to zero. Does it meet the third criteria, _i.e._ do $\braket{r|o}$ and $\braket{l|o}$ and $\braket{r|i}$ and $\braket{l|i}$ all yield 50% probabilities?

<h2>November 13, 2023</h2>

**Monday.** It's dawn at the start of a new week. Pausing to watch a red sunrise.

Let's continue where we left off yesterday‚Äîseeing what happens if we use the absolute value function for our multivalued function. We want to solve for $\ket{l}$:

$$\left(\bra{u}\frac{1}{2}+\bra{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)\ket{l}=0$$

Does this replacement work?

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\left(\bra{u}\frac{1}{2}+\bra{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\ket{u}\frac{1}{2}-\ket{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)&=\frac{1}{4}\braket{u|u}-\frac{1}{4}\braket{d|d}\\\\
&=\frac{1}{4}(1)-\frac{1}{4}(1)\\\\
&=0
\end{alignat}$$

It does! And so does the choice of

$$\left(-\ket{u}\frac{1}{2}+\ket{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)$$

I _think_ that that ambiguity maps to the ambiguity of up versus down. Whereas perhaps the square root's additional ambiguity maps to the ambiguity of $x$ vs. $z$ axes of orientation. We'll have a better guess shortly.

Now that we have the following...

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{r}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{l}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

...let's figure out $\ket{o}$ and $\ket{i}$. The probability of reading $+1$ versus $-1$ in the $\ket{u}$ orientation after setting up $\ket{o}$ is once again 50%-50%.

$$\begin{align}
\left|\braket{u|o}\right|=\frac{1}{2}\\\\
\left|\braket{d|o}\right|=\frac{1}{2}
\end{align}$$

<h2>November 12, 2023</h2>

**Sunday.** Just got back from grocery shopping with Abi. It's suddenly winter-y cold today, making it feel strangely cozy inside. She's making us enchiladas verdes while I write.

I wondered what the relationship was between the concept of **probability amplitudes** being defined as _square roots_ of probabilities and the fact that square roots are a multivalued function, therefore conveniently introducing a "degree of freedom" to whatever relation they're describing. **Can a different multivalued function be used to represent spin states? If not, what do square roots enable that other multivalued functions don't?**

For example, the _absolute value_ function. Mimicking Lecture 2, suppose we assert

$$\ket{A}=\alpha_u\ket{u}+\alpha_d\ket{d}$$

But instead of saying that $\alpha_u^*\alpha_u$ and $\alpha_d^*\alpha_d$ are the probabilities of measuring $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$, suppose it's $|\alpha_u|$ and $|\alpha_d|$. Then we can say one potential solution for $\ket{r}$ is

$$\ket{r}=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}$$

Next, to "fix" $\ket{l}$, we have no choice but to import the concept of bra-vectors. (I see‚Äîthis is something I had left out until now.) We "know" that

$$\braket{r|l}=0$$

and so

$$\left(\bra{u}\frac{1}{2}+\bra{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)\ket{l}=0$$

Pause. What concepts did we begin with, and what concepts have we imported?

- We began with our own concept of "situations" notated $\ket{X}$ that act like **quantities**, _i.e._ can be added and multiplied to and with.
- We even began with the notation $\braket{Y|X}$ representing sort of a compound situation, pre-measurement.
- We did _not_ begin with the existence of the notation $\bra{Y}$. We've imported this along with the fact that, in this alternate system using the absolute value function, $\bra{Y}\equiv\ket{Y}$.
- And since the notation $\bra{Y}$ didn't even exist, we did _not_ begin with the fact that $\braket{Y|X}$ is simply a multiplication, $\bra{Y}\times\ket{X}$.

Okay! I think I have a better formulation of the original goal that will give rise to the algebra we're trying to assert:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>Given the symbols $\ket{u}$, $\ket{d}$, $\ket{r}$, $\ket{l}$, $\ket{o}$, $\ket{i}$ to represent <em>situations</em> (an orientation <em>and</em> measurement in a particular direction), and the symbols $\bra{u}$, $\bra{d}$, $\bra{r}$, $\bra{l}$, $\bra{o}$, $\bra{i}$ to mean a re-orientation in a particular direction (<em>without</em> measurement), can we invent an algebra in which these symbols can be treated as quantities (being addable, multipliable, etc.), and in which the multiplication of $\bra{y}\times\ket{x}$ not only represents the <em>situationship</em> $\braket{y|x}$ but conveniently <em>computes</em> to the probability of the situationship in that particular direction?</p>
</div>

Perfect‚Äîvery happy with this.
