Sometimes I spend weeks thinking about a thing, and it may all have been good work, but with nothing to show for it, it can feel like a waste and bring me down. I've found that writing out at least some of the days of thought adds some pep to my step during the long droughts. Sometimes it even helps me break out when I'm going in circles.

**Tuesday.** Last weekend I was at my sister's in New Jersey. Grace was in D.C.—I was there to take care of Milo. I took Milo around the block—it was Saturday, about 8am—wearing a thin peacoat, it was just barely warm enough not to be unpleasant, so I walked slow and breathed in the cold air, feeling it harden my skin—my eyes watered a little, focusing things. I teleport when I run. I was running from something at home, now or a long time ago, here or in Brooklyn. So I was inside, sitting at my sister's desk in the living room. (This is what she reads. This is what she wishes she...) My thoughts muffling the sound of cooking in the kitchen, between 5 feet and 5 miles away. ("안슨한테 이거 먼저 데우라고 말해, 그다음...") I was 18,

and daylight broke. I paced 3 steps, turned, 3 steps back, in a shoulder's width of floorspace next to lofted bed, in a bedroom the size of a queen-size mattress. Troy was always grey, even on sunny days; rays of grey shone through the blinds.

It took about a month but, for the first time since the idea came to me in 2016, here's **the tether theory**, written out:

<!--TODO: Consider linking past mentions to this article.-->

<!--<div class="declaration"><p>-->

### The Tether Theory (T3)

**T3** is an idea about the role of _human observation_ in quantum effects. It presupposes, as many theories have, that there exists at least one **additional time dimension**—which might be understood in the popular way of "multiple timelines" or "parallel universes"—as well as particles that move along that dimension, _i.e._ crossing timelines or universes. Consequently, cause and effect tie together not only past with future, but _many_ pasts with _many_ futures. There's nothing particularly novel up to this point.

T3's main proposal however, is that **human brains** are an unprecedented object in the universe, capable of _observing_ literally a single one of the tiniest possible events in the universe, _e.g._ _what a photon did_, and as a result potentially putting into motion a headswimmingly vast chain of events. Say at first it's a handful of scientists conversing, writing, and publishing—imagine the vibrating vocal chords, muscles contracting to make gestures of the face and hands, coffee brewing at 367K and dripping one night in service of a final draft, fingers pressing thousands of keys. Say then the findings find their way to scientific news—pulses of electricity and light cross transoceanic cables and fan out to data centers around the world as millions of smartphones pull the latest feed, _each_ emitting _10 quadrillion photons_ per second at specific wavelengths to shine out the letters of the headline, which at least thousands of scientists and enthusiasts pause to read, to think about _what that one photon did_. Say, finally, the discovery is groundbreaking—then over the next decade, new research alters the lifecourse of those who get involved—where they'll live and for how many years—and therefore the lifecourse of their families; new experiments call for construction and transport of new equipment; new editions of textbooks print, new lectures are given, new YouTube content is produced, and new ideas enter the minds of a new generation of scientists. When in the history of the universe has a _single_ particle been able to influence the motion of _countless_—I unseriously estimate at somewhere between $10^{30}$ and $10^{50}$—particles? All made possible by an object—some 1,300 cubic centimeters in size—a grand amplifier of events—the human brain.

But we have to qualify some of what we've said. **First, resulting events are not always unique to a single cause**. The coffee may brew that night regardless, the phone screen emits just as many photons for a different headline, and new editions of textbooks are due anyway. **Second, resulting events are not forever _divergent_.** The commuter who took a minute to ponder the headline yet catches the same train, in year 3024 it does not matter* whether this discovery was made in the US in 2024 or Finland in 2026 (and via observing different photons), and life on Earth in all timelines will likely end. Actually these two points are one and the same, just presented from different angles. The first is saying that a _common present_ is possible through _multiple pasts_. The second is saying that _multiple presents_ can become a _common future_. In other words, **timelines converge**.

Really try to visualize this: Standing at the point where they converge, one looks back to see timelines like tendrils, disappearing into the horizon, tethering a multitude of pasts to this moment. One way or another, all those timelines had to play out in such a way that they coincide here, now. But imagine 60 seconds before the coincision—the timelines are not all quite aligned, but close. 30 seconds before—the timelines are getting even closer to one another. Imagine 15 seconds, 5 seconds, 1 second—the timelines are becoming so similar that if you were to "jump" from one timeline to its adjacent, you might not even notice a difference. Imagine a millisecond, a microsecond, a nanosecond—you could travel _through_ timelines, _i.e._ cruising from timeline to timeline, yet feel no "glitch"—it's smooth—it's _continuous_. **T3 presupposes continuity in all dimensions.** Between any timeline and another, there is an infinite number of timelines that gradually morph one timeline's circumstances to the other's—it's really a _gradient_ of parallel universes. This is key to understanding T3.

So finally, we can express T3's connection between the human brain and quantum effects. We'll take the most famous experiment in quantum physics—Young's double slit experiment—and its counterintuitive results, and show how T3 makes them make perfect sense.

**Update:** Actually, I've decided to publish the second part as an article, possibly with original illustrations by Abi.

<!--

 1. wait, why is it a necessity that parallel timelines are actual timelines (and not just emptiness)? how would a flatlander envision time as a 3rd dimension?
 2. i guess if all matter were bound to the 3-surface, then a "sweep" is, at least, abstractly useful
 3. what if all matter moves in the time dimension? (whoa, what if particles with different energies are simply moving a different angles? but then why is it quantized?) well then the sweeping...
 4. what is time, is PoCT unavoidable?
 5. imagine (s, t, u), whoa, visualize an electron moving backward and forward in time... is it like the s/p/d/f orbital patterns?
 6. okay but bringing it back... it's the mesh: it's not that it's a PoCT/extrusion... but an exchange of particles with nearby universes... but the range of "nearby" is quite large, bc speed of light, etc. order of 1/3 km in fact... ah and maybe even similar matter, like a pool of mass... imagine the sun is actually 4D/5D, i.e. electromagnetically attracks particles into a higher dimensional sphere, same with gravity in 4D
 7. what is magnetism? perpendicular to electro..



- imagine the timeline where it went through 1 slit
- imagine the timeline where it went through the other
- imagine the gradient between them

notes from sat may 11
- what happens at bifurcations? (seeming) ... oh shit, many worlds? ... ah shit, imagine a photon beam and a reflective angle that has a corner ... on one side of the corner the beam reflects one way ... on the other the other way ... what happens at the transition? in an ideal corner (which maybe doesn't exist) ... it goes one way or another ... maybe these are tiny little whirlpools of discontinuity? or no, it's still continuous, just "vacant"? oh, maybe realistically, there's no such thing as a perfect corner, so it's a rounded gradient? ok what about when particles interact with particles?
- car crash
- make the train vs miss the train, how does it resolve through the rest of the day? you get to the office 15 minutes later. imagine the 2 phantoms the rest of the day, coming home slightly differently, different order of events at home, etc. then imagine tens of phantoms. it's another phantom for every "corner" situation throughout the day. zoom out enough, and the probability of finding you at location X is 100% still.
- mathematica graph. s-t-u. bifurcation... say train delay ... say get hurt, or run into someone you end up marrying ... basically diverges for generations of humans ... what is "between" those timelines? (huh, this is all assuming PoCT isn't it. in ITT... _you_ are it, _you_ move into another _u_ and there is not another one ... ... ... )
- okay wait... so i've been assuming PoCT ... so particles exist infinitely in other timelines? so it's actually a body of particles? ... or no, okay, OKAY WOW, it's more like, each particle does exist in only one timeline, but the mesh of particles moving in and out of timelines (ah, maybe by electromagnetic force... omg electromagnetic force keeps us in one timeline???) the mesh of particles appearing and disappearing, is who we are. so in the next door timeline, there's also us, but made up of totally different electrons.
- ooooh what if it's not completely discontinuous, just a very high level of energy required to "climb" that gradient


I first conceived of this idea in 2016, and scribbled it in the margins of a dark green, library-bound copy of Nabokov's _Lolita_. As a reader you can't see it, [how hard that was to come up with]



Our conception of "sameness" is founded on 4 dimensions. Sameness is different in 5 dimensions.



if a cat looks, then no difference
omg, imagine a timeline where it read slit A, another slit B, what is the continuous gradient between them? it must be the superposition... the non-measuring

TODO - find picture of original inscription, say, i scribbled a notion in 2016, then in 2019 drew out the thing on paper that i remember vojta saw

an equal world, jimmy, john






Before we explain its link to quantum mechanics,


As do we to T3. But one more concept is necessary to grasp. T3 presupposes **continuity** as well. Imagine yourself as a 2D drawing.

next
- universe is continuous
- things aren't _that_ different in the universe next door
- we are macroscopic, already collapsed, already converged in all neighboring parallel universes
- if the photon went through 1 hole in our universe, then it went through the same hole in all neighboring parallel universes
- therefore no interference, if photons need to come from the other hole from other universes
- what happens while not being measured? i wanna say, it's very random so goes through both holes
- ok but why does measuring... oh, because when we measure, a bunch of macroscopic processes happen that would be so different from the interference staying or the other hole being recorded
- so... somehow that universe does not happen? OH. the contraction/impossibility is the force that modifies ("tethers") the past to start behaving in a way that this particular future is the convergent in the neighborhood
- question: what happens in a universe far away? and what happens in between? maybe in this universe, it was doomed to be the first hole. there is no universe with the second hole. only it fades out to the experiment not happening

tie in
- what collapse of the wave function really is
- this view also intimates at the possibility that forces are not just pure, elemental, given parts of nature, but an emergent property ... (similar to how they used to believe in 4 elements)
- (Perhaps a "force" is merely an independent-seeming mechanism we infer from our myopic, timeslice-by-timeslice view of the universe in its grander evolution toward destiny.)

other
- reverse causality too, the LHC, God particle
- maybe the scatter picture i have is actually still continuous in higher dimensional eyes...
- astounding result, the fate of humanity; in the end, everyone on this planet will die. this novelty vortex will collapse. all this near-infinity of worlds, are tethered to the same end. unless we manage to colonize ... but even then, all these worlds, are tethered to a very narrow set of worlds for some time, the ones that make it to ... and those futures don't tether to everyone presently, e.g. those who will not have an influence on who escapes this planet

So these are the tasks ahead of me:

 1. Read more broadly and more deeply about Young's double slit experiment to cement my understanding, call out common misunderstandings, and come up with experimental ideas for T3.


Now, I want to take us a meaningful step toward the heart of T3.

Recall Young's double split experiment.

 1. Suppose particles move through $u$-time, _i.e._ have a $u$-component to their velocity (momentum), and collide _at_ particular **timelines**, arriving at a slant from _adjacent_ timelines. Then more generally, **events** (newly defined) in our timeline depend on a chain reaction of events not exclusively in _our_ timeline, but including _neighboring_ timelines (the size of the "neighborhood"" perhaps bound by the speed of light).

 1.

—but let's give this our own name, **timeplane**—
collide _with $u$-momentum_, _i.e_ meet at our sliver of $t$-time _from other slivers of $t$-time.**

- i need to imagine the 4th dimension more, how to options expand from 2, 3, 4
- next, enumerate potential paths (e.g. electron wave, collisions, etc.)
- automatic bookmark link generation for h2's
- somehow make this chapter a reference, as well as maybe the previous one on ITT vs PoCT
- bold first mention of T3

The recent 7-week journey into dimensionality was supposed to be a prerequisite to continuing about **the tether theory** (T3), which we first mentioned in [January](#January21222024). Back then, we were wondering what it meant to "move" a $\Delta{u}$ in the $(s,t,u)$-space. Really, we were wanting an introduction to $u$-time, and we got that, along the way declaring an ITT vs. PoCT interpretation of "movement," establishing particles definitively as points (not bodies), and clarifying that all $n$-clouds are abstract constructions. But we still never got the point out. What _is_ T3? Let's see how long it takes me to write a summary...

Let's start dialing in our exploration of language, and start building _Mathematica_ skills too.

A $\textrm{1c/1s,1t}$ depicts a **1-cloud** of **points** (not ~**events**~ or ~**visits**~), _e.g._ the up-and-down movement of a **<s>point-</s>particle** over time:

<img src="../shared/assets/20240331-mma-1c1s1t.png" class="mma"/>

We consciously use a dashed line so as to always remember that we are _never_ talking about a ~**body of particles**~, but an abstract history—a timelapse—of one. (Aided by this, we can drop the term ~**trail**~, which served the same purpose.)

Any 1-cloud may go by the vernacular, **curve**. But the previously explored terms ~**rigid**~ and ~**curvy**~ aren't particularly useful—the former is perhaps just an extreme degree of the latter, in the sense of **fractional dimensions**, which if valid might notated with decimals, _e.g._ $\textrm{1.2c/1s,1t}$. A more useful set of classifiers for curves may be **functional** versus **non-functional**, _with respect to time_. Here's a <em>non-</em>functional example, resulting in a particle existing at 2 points at the same time:

<img src="../shared/assets/20240331-mma-1c1s1tnf.png" class="mma"/>

Perhaps there's nothing special about a particle moving that way—merely foreign to our human experience with macroscopic materials. But the word "moving" reminds us to consider the **ITT** versus **PoCT** models. In the ITT model, the very same curve may yet be "functional" over **$u$-time**...

<img src="../shared/assets/20240331-mma-1c1s2t.png" class="mma"/>

...which we'd notate $\textrm{1c/1s,2t}$. Or, the very same curve may be non-functional in _both_ **$t$-time** _and_ $u$-time:

<img src="../shared/assets/20240331-mma-1c1s2tnf.png" class="mma"/>

If we wanted to notate functionality, then perhaps we'd call our 2 examples $\textrm{1c/1s,1t*}$ and $\textrm{1c/1s,2t**}$.

And a bit of a non-sequitor but, implicitly we appear to assume **continuity** of curves—perhaps of all **_n_-clouds**. Perhaps _discontinuity_ only exists as a consequence of discontinuous operations (such as the "slicing" of **timescans** in PoCT), or only _appears_ to exist due to myopia, _e.g._ our anatomies don't sufficiently relay effects in **$u$-time** to our conscious perceptions. (Imagine a hyperdense fog on each side of your line-of-sight, leaving only a thin plane of perception.)

Anyway, next, a $\textrm{2c/1s,1t}$ depicts a 2-cloud of points. I have been confused about the meaning of this for quite some time, but finally something coherent is coming together:

- The _functional_ $\textrm{1c/1s,1t}$ is a concept _we_ happen to privilege, owing to its familiar status in our day-to-day, as well as its relevance to particles and _movement_—we call it a **path**. The reality of this concept is completely dependent on our experience of being alive, and therefore, completely arbitrary—it's no more "real" than other abstract concepts we might invent. For example, consider a $\textrm{1c/2s}$—for example, an ellipse—but instead of considering it a path, consider it the orbit of a planet. As is well-known, the motion of a planet is not elliptic, but more a spiral, but not even that really, factoring in the motion of galaxies and larger bodies. Yet, using the Sun as a **frame of reference**, an ellipse is a _useful, if abstract, concept_. What is our ability to perceive motion, then, if not also a _useful concept_—one that aided our survival to be pondering this in the first place?

- Now consider a $\textrm{2c/2s}$—an **area**—the spill of a liquid over a surface (the surface perhaps acting as a frame of reference)—or the regions of bone _missed_ by X-rays, as caught on X-ray film. Or imagine a $\textrm{2c/3s}$—an **cross-section**—perhaps the region where a concrete slab would block a nuclear explosion's radiation. Finally, a $\textrm{3c/3s}$—a **volume**—a water droplet—or an electron cloud under a certain probability threshold.

- Then it's finally possible to imagine even a completely non-functional $\textrm{1c/1s,1t*}$ without apprehension—a **line segment** sitting _perpendicularly_ to one point in time, happens just to represent a region of oscillation in one dimension. $\textrm{2c/1s,1t*}$—an expanding **ray** from a single point, happens to represent the maximum reach of a particle within the bounds of the speed of light in one space dimension—in _two_ space dimensions, a **cone**, a.k.a. a $\textrm{3c/2s,1t*}$.

- A remark on the use of **asterisks**. The asterisk on a time dimension was meant to indicate that the _space_ dimension doesn't respect uniqueness per time in that time dimension. So it seemed to me throughout this post that I'd made a mistake: With _multiple_ space dimensions, how do we know _which_ space dimensions aren't being respectful? Worse, with multiple asterisked _time_ dimensions, how do we know which pairings of space and time dimensions are disrespectful? But then a resolution came to me: If we consider physics being **invariant** to orientation in space, _i.e._ if space dimensions are arbitrarily interchangeable, then the answer is clear: Disrespect doesn't discriminate—the asterisk on a time dimension always applies to _all_ space dimensions. Fine then. But still, I prefer a heuristic alternative: The asterisk is merely meant to hint at an **unintuitive** situation.

- There's a common thread among the _region of osccilation_, the _ray of reach_, and the _cone of reach_, besides that they were all non-functional in time. It's that they could all be seen as spanning _possibilities_ a.k.a. **possibility-space** a.k.a. $u$-time. Thinking of it this way, our intuition returns, hand-in-hand with functionality—and in notation, we'd add a second time dimension and drop the asterisks: $\textrm{1c/1s,2t}$, $\textrm{2c/1s,2t}$, and $\textrm{3c/2s,2t}$. However, let's call this kind of possibility-making **contrived**, because the possibilities originate from our _not knowing_ about phase or initial conditions, as opposed to a "real" fabric of possibilities.

- There's also a common thread among the _area of spill_, the _X-ray_, and the _cross-section of concrete_, besides that they all lacked a time dimension. It's that they represented bodies of particles rather than a single particle at multiple points (at different times or different possibilities). As mentioned before, we're more interested in single particles, at least to start, so I don't imagine _areas_ and _volumes_ (in space, not extended to time) coming to play.

This has been some monumental progress in my understanding of dimensionality. A lot of ideas ahead.

Maybe I'll get Nick's number too—he offered to show me around Meta's office later this week.-->

Anyway, back to dimensionality. Last time, I said this:

<blockquote>We imprecisely say that the possible locations of a point-particle are <em>here</em> and <em>there</em>, but without a time component, neither <em>here</em> nor <em>there</em> are precise locations to even say a particle has been or will be.</blockquote>

This brings me back to a paradox I've never resolved. Envisioning space down-dimensioned as the 2-surface of a sphere whose radial dimension is time, I imagined the expansion of that sphere being responsible for moving us "forward in time." But how can I say _moving_? (Take a moment to perceive what's wrong with that.) To _move_ is to _change location "over time"_, but if time is _part_ of the location $(x_0, y_0, t_0)$ then over what "time" does the location change to another, $(x_1, y_1, t_1)$? It must be another _kind_ of time—I've heard it called _kime_—but I prefer to call it $u$-time. This forces us to consider: Do we _move_ through $u$-time, necessitating a $v$-time, _ad infinitum_? Or is there a count of dimensions at which nothing moves? But how does _change_ happen if nothing moves? Ah, I think I see. **To model time as a spatial dimension, we _must_ be able to explain _change_—either by introducing a _higher_ time dimension, or by offering a theory of how _we've_ come to be able to perceive change, despite inhabiting an unchanging, static universe.**

There's nothing impossible about the universe being infinitely dimensioned—in fact in some ways, it's stranger to think it'd be finite and specifically numbered. But then why do the first 3 dimensions feel so qualitatively different from the time dimension(s)? Well, that could just be that our sensory organs developed that way.

The latter possibility is more intriguing. How can a _perception_ of change arise from within a structure that doesn't change? The answer may be that it can't. But if it _could_, then it teases a physical realization of the universe as a high-dimensional fractal.

Both seem possible to me. To consider future ideas in both contexts, let's name them the **infinite time theory (ITT)** and the **perception-of-change theory (PoCT)**.

More can be said about PoCT. Whatever the "perceiving" mechanism is, it must be something like a scanner "reading" the static universe slice by slice—in our case, 3-slice by 3-slice. Then, a point-particle _in 3-space_ would actually be a **body** of particles—an actual curve through time (_i.e._ not only a graph representation)—because otherwise the point-particle would exist only at a particular time, and disappear, instantaneously.

One more disjointed thought. Going back to the 3-surfaced radial-time 4-sphere model, I realize now that I've always "felt" a sense of time that _wasn't_ $t$. In fact what was happening was, I was perceiving $u$-time _via_ my sense of _motion_. Is motion a human-friendly way to "visualize" an extra dimension? (For example, I never found color gradients particularly intuitive.) That would be quite useful if the case—something for our toolbox to try using later.

<h2>February 3, 4, 5 & 6, 2024</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Saturday.** Leaving for Singapore tomorrow; we've been pre-jetlagging ourselves pretty successfully. // **Sunday (Germany).** Connecting in Frankfurt to sleep in a bed; they can't find our checked bags; nothing we can do for now. // **Monday (Germany).** They say our bags should have forwarded despite the non-normal connection. 🤞 // **Tuesday (Singapore).** They did! Abi's parents Betty and Felipe picked us up and we went to Abi's sister's (Chloe, Josh, and baby Noel) to have dinner.

</div>

Here's some sporadic progress made over that timeframe.

Previously we explored a lot of language. That will continue here. Let's review some of our invented terms:

- A $\textrm{1c/1s-1t}$ (a "path") depicts a 1-cloud of events on a line.

Q: Can this path be curvy? Or does curviness make it a $\textrm{2c/1s-1t}$? Recall our original attempt to define rigidity and curviness, substituting **span** for **cloud**:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    Basically, for any <i>n</i>-span in <i>m</i>-space, if <i>n = m</i>, then the span is a <b>rigid span</b>; while if <i>n < m</i>, the span <em>can</em> be a <b>curvy span</b> in any number of dimensions up to <i>m-1</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe the terms <b>line</b>, <b>area</b>, and <b>volume</b> stand for the rigid spans, while the terms <b>curve</b>, <b>surface</b>, and <b>?</b> stand for the curvy spans.
  </p>
</div>

There we seem to have been saying that a curve would still be a $\textrm{1c/1s-1t}$. But there's an alternative answer that resonates with me—A curve is **fractionally dimensioned** between 1.0 and 2.0, rigid at 1.0, and space-filling and equivalent to a rigid area at 2.0.

I want to denote this with $\textrm{1.xc/1s-1t}$, but I'm not sure how fractional dimensions work when a curve is non-space-filling but curving in skip-dimensions, _e.g._ coiled in 3 dimensions.

- A $\textrm{2c/1s-1t}$ depicts a 2-cloud of ... ?

I seem to be stuck here. I feel a subtle difference between "possible" and "potential," leaning toward the latter for some reason related to time. And similar between "locations," "events," and "configurations." Consider these in conjunction:

- A $\textrm{2c/2s}$ depicts a 2-cloud of ... ?
- A $\textrm{2c/2s-1t}$ depicts a 2-cloud of ... ?

I truly don't understand why, but to me "possible locations" feel like locations I can **access** _at any time_, while "potential locations" feels like locations I can access _at a specific time_ (whether past or future). Why did the word "access" come up? It's a bit circular, because the notion of "possible" or "potential" is embedded within it. But it came up because I was picturing myself putting a pin on a specific location and asking myself, _"Can I put a pin here?"_ It'd be less circular to say, rather than locations I can access, **locations a point-particle can be**—at any time versus at a specific time.

It may simply have to do with each word's common usage. On a human level, I can go to church and back, saying they are both _possible_ locations that I can "access" at any time. On a particle(s) level, our entire solar system is flinging across space (toward the Great Attractor) at over 1.3 million miles an hour—there is no Earth in the location in the void we've left behind—there's no going back home. So, a $2c/2s$ _seems_ like a 2-cloud of _possible locations_ (irrespective of time), but only on a human level. We imprecisely say that the possible locations of a point-particle are _here_ and _there_, but without a time component, neither _here_ nor _there_ are precise locations to even say a particle has been or will be.

There's something imprecise about what I've just said. I'll unpack it next time.

It was good to catch up with Lotus at Honey's (still serving Daggers<sup>†††</sup>); ran into Amar in the line; and later Fallon—who for some reason I always feel some kind of wholesome joy to see; and I saw Kiko in the distance too but felt shy to say hi. // **Saturday.** Amy had an extra ticket to Dirty Circus at House of Yes—we were both blown away, wow—highly recommend. // **Wednesday.** Just coming back from Ensenada with Abi, Amy, and Kathy.

</div>

Not me though. So anyway, we left off at wanting to investigate dimensional analogues—particularly my misuse of them. I think I've been thrown off all this time by traditional graphs of **displacement** over time, which are not depictions of anything _as it exists_, but rather more like a _timelapse_ of it. To say it more boldly, _any illustration other than a **point** is an **visual extrapolation**, not a **physically isomorphic representation**_. Unless we're specifically talking about a **body** of many points. **(This post is going to use a _lot_ of quoting and bolding and emphasis, because I'm actively searching for new language).** So for example, a **curve** (to use a more general term for a line) on the $(x, t)$ plane depicts the $x$ displacement of a thing over time. Meanwhile, a curve on the $(x, y)$ plane invites different words: We might say it depicts a relationship between a thing's $x$ and $y$ displacements, caused perhaps by some kind of constraint. (The difference might have more to do with our natural sense of time, which always moves in one direction.) But anyway, in either case, the point is that the curve doesn't mean **simultaneous existence** at every point on the curve.

Let's try making up some terminology to classify things:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    Let's write <b><i>n</i>-span</b> to mean an <i>n</i>-dimensional connected subset of an <i>n-or-more</i>-dimensional space. This is an overly complicated way to say that a <b>1-span</b> is a curve, a <b>2-span</b> is an area, a <b>3-span</b> is a volume, and so forth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's write <b><i>(s, t)</i>-space</b> to mean an <i>s+t</i>-dimensional space with <i>s</i> spatial dimensions and <i>t</i> temporal dimensions. So, <b>(3, 1)-space</b> is the popularly known world we live in.
  </p>
</div>

By the way, do I _actually_ think space and time are different "kinds" of dimensions? Yes and no. For one thing, time certainly _feels_ distinct from space, in that our experience of "movement" in time has only gone in one direction ever. So it could be fair to treat them as distinct, _e.g._ in order to better highlight pitfalls that may rise from _not_ thinking about time as we would normally about space. But more "objectively" even, there _may_ be a real fact behind _why_ masses move or interact differently in certain dimensions, _e.g._ perhaps we _can_ move in the other direction of time, but some overwhelming constraint prevents that, at least as far as our instruments can detect.

Now some remarks about the relationship between spans and spaces:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    A 1-span in 1-space is still a "curve," but not a <em>curvy</em> curve, because it is restricted to 1-space. The 1-span in 2-space however can properly be <em>curvy</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's the same deal with 2-spans in 2-space versus 3-space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Basically, for any <i>n</i>-span in <i>m</i>-space, if <i>n = m</i>, then the span is a <b>rigid span</b>; while if <i>n < m</i>, the span <em>can</em> be a <b>curvy span</b> in any number of dimensions up to <i>m-1</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe the terms <b>line</b>, <b>area</b>, and <b>volume</b> stand for the rigid spans, while the terms <b>curve</b>, <b>surface</b>, and <b>?</b> stand for the curvy spans.
  </p>
</div>

And finally, some shorthand:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    When speaking of, for example, a 2-span in <i>(3, 1)</i>-space, we may notate it: $$\textrm{2c/3s-1t}$$
  </p>
</div>

Let's use our new words to re-say what we've already said. **I'm still exploring terminology, so continue to bear with me through all the bold text.**

- A $\textrm{1c/1s-1t}$ depicts the **path** of a **point-particle** over time.
- A $\textrm{1c/2s}$ depicts **valid** or **possible** **pairings** between the $x$ and $y$ **positions** of a point-particle, due to some **constraint**.

It's notable that the relationships are not necessarily **functional**—imagine a circle, a sine wave, a spiral. Though, there seems to be something significant about **continuity** and **non-branching** that contributes to our perception of a "curve." I want to rephrase that in terms of $\epsilon$-radius **neighborhoods** but it's a bit tricky and not the main point here; let's move on.

- A $\textrm{2c/2s}$ (a rigid span) depicts an area of valid or possible pairings between the $x$ and $y$ positions of a point-particle, due to some constraint.

We desperately need some shorthand for that:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    Instead of saying, <i>"a curve (or surface, or ?) of valid or possible pairings (or <b>tuples</b>) between the $x$ ($y$, $z$, ...) positions of a point-particle, due to some constraint,"</i> we will say an <b><i>n</i>-cloud of locations</b>, or an <b><i>n</i>-cloud of events</b> if a time dimension is involved, or perhaps an <b><i>n</i>-cloud of configurations</b> in general, where <i>n</i> stands for the number of dimensions each relationship binds, <i>e.g.</i> as <i>n</i>-tuples.
  </p>
</div>

There was more said here, but I am reorganizing them in a future post.

<!--
  I can think of a strategy that might help me avoid this pitfall: I should draw curves now on using dotted lines, and maybe emphasize a specific position on the curve using a bold point.
-->

 <!-- The 1-dimensional $s$ doesn't lend itself to 360 degrees of directions, at least not in a way I understand. So I would prefer to do my thinking with at least a 2-dimensional $s$. But how do I visualize $(s_x, s_y, t, u)$? I think a traditional technique is to use colors. Which dimension becomes colors then? -->

<!-- This might be some of the most important thinking I've done in my life. I'm (over)excited to clarify aspects of dimensional analogizing that I've always been confused by. Next let's kick it up a dimension.

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    Now add a 3rd dimension, $(x, y, z)$. This space supports 3 types of entities. The first two are exactly the same as for $(x, y)$—point particles and <b>representational curves</b>, we'll call them. The third would be <b>representational surfaces</b>—essentially the same thing.
  </p>
</div>

It appears to be too difficult for me to imagine what a surface in $(x, y, t)$ means. I'll skip this for now. The major takeaway is that what's <em>real</em>, is still the point particle, nothing else.

Okay, but how did we get here from talking about colors?

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    For a <em>point particle</em> in $(x, y)$, adding a colored spatial dimension $z$ can show the "elevation" of that particle; adding a colored temporal dimension $t$ can show whether its position was in a relative past or relative future. These aren't useful to us at all of course, since a 3-dimensional $(x, y, z)$ or $(x, y, t)$ are far easier to see the same thing with.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a <em>representational curve</em> in $(x, y)$, adding a colored <em>temporal</em> dimension $t$, is very difficult to imagine conceptually; adding a colored <em>spatial</em> dimension $y$ to $(x, t)$ is much easier. This style of representation highlights <em>motion</em> in a primary spatial dimension while backgrounding a secondary spatial dimension.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's also possible to plot a <em>surface</em> in $(x, y)$ using color to indicate elevation again (creating a topographic map) or to indicate time (but this is quite difficult to imagine conceptually as well). But note that now we're talking about bodies of particles
  <p>
    For a <em>point particle</em> in $(x, y)$, adding a colored spatial dimension $z$ can show the "elevation"

This past weekend I began to revive the tether theory (T3). It's more urgent than learning quantum mechanics or finding a visual presentation of the incompleteness theorem or anything else I'm doing.

In particular, I want to think about what it means to "move" a $\Delta u$ in the $(s, t, u)$ hyperspace. Drawing out an example already clarified several things for me:

![](../shared/assets/20240221-t3-stu.png)

Notice in the 1-dimensional representation of $s$, only 2 directions are possible, $\Delta s$ and $-\Delta s$. And $t$ is an axis, so this is a **static frame**, a term I use to remind myself that there's _no concept of motion_. I can see that...

 1. it was never a necessity that all possible $\Delta s$ were represented in the neighborhood of $\Delta u$—from any displacement of $s$, any $\Delta s$ is valid—

 1. which means $(s, t)$-slices of $(s, t, u)$ _can_ exist as duplicates—there's no uniqueness constraint—and

 1. which also means not all possible $(s, t)$-slices _have_ to exist!

This means my so-far-persistent imagination that in 2,3-space $\Delta u$ must cover all $\Delta\theta$ and $\Delta\phi$, was unnecessary! The _only_ constraint is that $\Delta s$ is continuous over $\Delta u$, whichever potential direction it goes within its dimension(s).

<!-- By the way, a minor thing to point out about that drawing. It wasn't necessary either for the displacement in $s$ to be the same across $u$. They would almost always be varied. -->

I've always felt that my grasp of dimensional analogues was disorganized and inconsistent. Next time I'd like to focus on that, and maybe clarify the subject for myself once and for all.

1. Page 181. "The Propositional Calculus." Here _GEB_ introduces propositional logic using a limited set of symbols. I like that it says **the fantasy rule** instead of an **assumption**.

1. Page 204. "Typographical Number Theory." Here _GEB_ introduces zero and successors (_e.g._ **SSS0**), variables (_e.g._ **a``**), and addition and multiplication, and merges in what we'd learned about propositional logic. Some worthwhile exercises on page 215. Then the Five Peano Postulates. Then **specification** and **generalization**. A light introduction to $\omega$-inconsistency. Then **induction**. Then a long, sample proof of the commutativity of addition in TNT.

1. Page 261. "Mumon and Godel." In the middle of this chapter, _GEB_ introduces a numbering system for **MIU**, then demonstrates the relationship between typographic operations and arithmetic. (This is a good reference to think about the need for exponents and modulo.) Then **producible numbers** and **recursively enumerable sets**. Okay, here's where my grasp starts to unravel, so let me engage more deeply and solve some of the exercises.

<h2>December 18, 2023</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Monday.** _"Take your credit and sit down!"_ 🤣

</div>

Yesterday, we quickly found that no solution exists for
$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix*}[r]50\\% \\\\ 100\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&=\alpha_u\begin{bmatrix*}[r]100\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&&+\alpha_d\begin{bmatrix*}[r]0\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}
\end{alignat}$$

Next we wondered how (and why) the complex domain and representing probabilities as their square roots might help. First let's rewrite the percentages as decimals—this is the same equation that has no solution:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}&=\alpha_u\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ \frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}&&+\alpha_d\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ \frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

Here's a fleeting but key idea, I think: In _QMTTM_, $\ket{r}$ alone doesn't contain the entire situationship. Multiplying it with $\bra{u}$ eliminates the $\alpha_d$ term and leaves $\alpha_u$, which _wholly_ and _only_ contains the probability amplitude. Contrast that to our setup, where $\ket{r}$ contains the entire situationship by itself, and the $\alpha$ coefficients serve to massage $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$'s situationships into $\ket{r}$'s.

So I wonder two things. (1) Was there even a valid rationale behind setting up a linear equation of the same form, when the nature of the ket vectors were completely different? (2) If we entertain that possibility, then have we "transferred" probability information from the coefficients to the ket vectors? (Then what information do the coefficients represent?)

<div class="journal">

  **Sunday.** Later today we're going to Hey Yuet for Kaz's birthday. // Back and continuing. Abi's watching Game of Thrones on the couch.

</div>

I want to outline where I'm headed next with this article:

1. Introduce the bra-ket notation using $\braket{u|r}$.
1. Restate that $\braket{u|r}$ is 50-50.
1. State that $\braket{d|r}$ is equivalent, though swapped.
1. Extend to $\braket{o|r}$ and $\braket{i|r}$.
1. Extend to $\braket{r|r}$ and $\braket{l|r}$.
1. Point out redundance of the probability of $-1$. 𝒜 can only measure $+1$ or $-1$ so there's no situation where you'd find probabilities not summing to 100%.
1. Assert $\ket{r}$'s set of probabilities as its **situationship**—the property we've been looking for—temporaneously notated $\\{50\\%, 50\\%, 100\\%, 0\\%, 50\\%, 50\\%\\}$—then write out all 6 situations' situationships.
1. Point out redundance of considering $\braket{d|r}$, $\braket{i|r}$, and $\braket{l|r}$, compacting the notation to $\\{50\\%, 100\\%, 50\\%\\}$, etc. for all 6 situations' situationships.
1. Then we can consider the algebra:
$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\ket{r}&=\alpha_u\ket{u}&&+\alpha_d\ket{d}\\\\
\\{50\\%, 100\\%, 50\\%\\}&=\alpha_u\\{100\\%, 50\\%, 50\\%\\}&&+\alpha_d\\{0\\%, 50\\%, 50\\%\\}
\end{alignat}$$

Great. Now I can look ahead exploratively, before spending time writing up all of the above. Suppose we interpreted situationships as column vectors:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix*}[r]50\\% \\\\ 100\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&=\alpha_u\begin{bmatrix*}[r]100\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&&+\alpha_d\begin{bmatrix*}[r]0\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}
\end{alignat}$$

That would force $\alpha_u=\frac{1}{2}$ but then $\alpha_d$ must be $\frac{3}{2}$ to satisfy the middle row or also $\frac{1}{2}$ to satisfy the bottom row. So there appears to be no solution.

Let's be creative though. How might the complex domain help? How might representing probabilities as their square roots help? The two have to work together—the squaring of a complex number is where its power lies.

<h2>December 10, 2023</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Sunday.** Impenetrable grey.

</div>

Where was I headed, that it seemed advantageous to define a "situationship" as a set of probabilities of measuring in all directions, rather than just one? ... Ah right—I was aiming to show that 2 probabilities were sufficient—and that those probabilities might as well be the ones associated with $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$. But how could I not have noticed such a glaring error? It's not an attribute of $\braket{r|u}$ that's a situationship; it's $\ket{u}$. So:

$$\ket{u}=\\{50\\%, 50\\%, 100\\%\\}$$

  **Saturday.** Just getting home from shooting a music video. It was more demanding than I expected—7 back-to-back takes with a short break in the middle. But it also went smoother than I expected, with Vlad's prep and experience and everyone in the band showing up early and being helpful. // **Sunday.** Can't move my neck this morning.

</div>

21 days ago, we formulated the following question:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>Given the symbols $\ket{u}$, $\ket{d}$, $\ket{r}$, $\ket{l}$, $\ket{o}$, $\ket{i}$ to represent <em>situations</em> (an orientation <em>and</em> measurement in a particular direction), and the symbols $\bra{u}$, $\bra{d}$, $\bra{r}$, $\bra{l}$, $\bra{o}$, $\bra{i}$ to mean a re-orientation in a particular direction (<em>without</em> measurement), can we invent an algebra in which these symbols can be treated as quantities (being addable, multipliable, etc.), and in which the multiplication of $\bra{y}\times\ket{x}$ not only represents the <em>situationship</em> $\braket{y|x}$ but conveniently <em>computes</em> to the probability of the situationship in that particular direction?</p>
</div>

But I think it could use some more clarification. The "quantities" are of an unknown kind—an unknown _dimension_. We ourselves assert that the dimensionality of $\braket{x|y}$ is a probability (or some function thereof)—the probability of reading $\ket{x}$ in the next measurement. It almost seems like a neat trick that by that definition and experimentally, we know that $\braket{x|x}=1$ and $\braket{x|\bar{x}}=0$.

But why did we bring up the concept of multivalued functions? Right—we wondered if they were being used as a mechanism to allow 2 distinct situations to share the same situationship, _i.e._ both $\braket{u|r}$ and $\braket{u|o}$ compute to a 50% probability of measuring $\ket{u}$, but are different situations.

We found though that we could not recreate a working setup with the absolute value function over the real domain. When we tried with the squaring function over the complex domain, at first we also found 0 working setups. But in that attempt we had not used complex conjugates, which when introduced did lead to 2,048 working setups.

I think it's time to wrap up this arc. I had hoped to understand _why_ complex numbers, _why_ complex conjugation, _why_ probability "amplitudes," etc., but I feel I keep running into the doors of abstract algebra, which are locked and inaccessible to me at this time. I think I'm not ready to understand this part yet. And we haven't even gotten to generalizing the whole thing for arbitrary directions $\theta$ and $\phi$, which might even hold a clue about _why the squaring function_ (its relation to circles).

But here's a thing I kept wondering through this entire arc. _Had_ we been able to prove that no other multivalued function and algebraic setup could have met all the criteria and still produced a working setup, is that _why_ things are the way they are? I mean: Do we live in a universe that works this way _because_ no other physical setup is possible, because physical setups are a subset of algebraic setups, and we'd (hypothetically) found only one algebraic setup that works?

The lighting was exactly as dim as I prefer, it was easy to talk, and the bartender concocted something bespoke based on my usual criteria—Mezcal and citrus in a highball—it was 👌. **Friday.** It's 6am now, and a rare type of dawn. There's just a thin strip of smokey red and orange, rapidly shading into the dark blue of the night. And what look like impossibly bright fireflies in the horizon, aligned in an unnaturally curved line. (Planes landing at JFK.)

On Tuesday we stumbled upon **Pauli matrices** when we computed the spin operators for 1 of our 2,048 possibilities. Was it chance, or do all possibilities lead to Pauli matrices?

Excluding duplicates (ignoring ordering), there appear to be **4** distinct sets of "Pauli" matrices:

Here's the full <a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231130-mathematica">code</a>. The result, formatted:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\mathcal{P}_1 &= &&\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}&,\hspace{1em}&\begin{bmatrix}0 & -i \\\\ i & 0\end{bmatrix}&,\hspace{1em}\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\\\

\end{alignat}$$

$\mathcal{P}_1$ is the one used in QMTTM. My guess about there being 4 variants is that relative to a fixed up vs. down orientation on the z-axis, you can flip the x-axis, flip the y-axes, or flip both.

<h2>November 28, 2023</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Tuesday.** Met Amy and some coworkers at Metrorock Bushwick tonight. First time climbing in months—felt unexpectedly nice.

</div>

We left off at discovering 2,048 possible sets of coefficients using the square root as our multivalued function. We didn't yet attempt to create spin operators for any of them. It's tedious to keep doing that by hand though, so let's write a program.

In a first pass, I expand out the system of linear equations, _i.e._ from

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
&\begin{bmatrix}xa & xb \\\\ xc & xd\end{bmatrix}\ket{r} &&= &\ket{r} \\\\
&\begin{bmatrix}xa & xb \\\\ xc & xd\end{bmatrix}\ket{l} &&= -&\ket{l}
\end{alignat}$$

to

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
xa\ket{r}_1 &+ xb\ket{r}_2 &&= &\ket{r}_1 \\\\
xc\ket{r}_1 &+ xd\ket{r}_2 &&= &\ket{r}_2 \\\\
xa\ket{l}_1 &+ xb\ket{l}_2 &&= -&\ket{l}_1 \\\\
xc\ket{l}_1 &+ xd\ket{l}_2 &&= -&\ket{l}_2 \\\\
\end{alignat}$$

and using `Solve`:

<pre><code class="language-mathematica">
sigmaX = Solve[
  xa * r[[1]] + xb * r[[2]] == r[[1]] &&
  xa * l[[1]] + xb * l[[2]] == -l[[1]] &&
  xc * r[[1]] + xd * r[[2]] == r[[2]] &&
  xc * l[[1]] + xd * l[[2]] == -l[[2]],
  Flatten[{{xa, xb}, {xc, xd}}]
]

(*
  {{xa -> 0, xb -> -I, xc -> I, xd -> 0}}
  {{ya -> 0, yb -> 1, yc -> 1, yd -> 0}}
*)
</code></pre>

In a second pass, I use the intended language for these purposes, _i.e._ matrices, vectors, and dot products:

<pre><code class="language-mathematica">
sx = {{sx11, sx12}, {sx21, sx22}};
sxSolved = Solve[sx.r == r && sx.l == -l, Flatten[sx]]

(* {{sx11 -> 0, sx12 -> -1, sx21 -> -1, sx22 -> 0}} *)

sxSolvedMatrix = ArrayReshape[sxSolved[[1, All, 2]], {2, 2}]

(* {{0, -1}, {-1, 0}} *)
</code></pre>

Finally, packaging the above into a function, we can compute the 3 spin operators—$\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, $\sigma_z$—for just 1 of the 2,048 possibilities. The result:

<pre><code class="language-mathematica">{{{0, -I}, {I, 0}}, {{0, 1}, {1, 0}}, {{1, 0}, {0, -1}}}
</code></pre>

Formatted:

$$\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}0 & -i \\\\ i & 0\end{bmatrix}\hspace{2em}\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}\hspace{2em}\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}$$

Exactly the **Pauli matrices**! Was this chance or will all 2,048 possibilities reveal the same thing?

  **Monday.** My band's playing The Bowery Electric in a few hours.

</div>

Today I'm just making some corrections to previous notes. I had been solving for

$$\begin{alignat}{1}
\sigma_x&\ket{r} &&= &&\ket{r} \\\\
\sigma_x&\ket{l} &&= -&&\ket{r}
\end{alignat}$$

instead of

$$\begin{alignat}{1}
\sigma_x&\ket{r} &&= &\ket{r} \\\\
\sigma_x&\ket{l} &&= -&\ket{l}
\end{alignat}$$

I don't really get the latter. Maybe it'll come to me later.<sup>*</sup>

<sup>* **Later.** Okay, I can see a little farther. We have to remember that the negative sign is an _eigenvalue_, $\lambda=-1$, and that the definition of an _eigenvector_ is a vector that produces _a scalar multiple of itself_. I guess though, still, I'm wondering why we set up these particular relations...</sup>

  **Sunday.** Yesterday we watched _The Boy and the Heron_ at Angelika. It would have been overwhelming(ly confusing) had Abi not introduced me to _Paprika_ and _Howl's Moving Castle_ earlier this year. Maybe my interpretation is obvious and banal, but it moved me to think about the fantastic worlds our unconscious will construct and journey, to protect us from our deepest hurts.

</div>

Before we explore other multivalued functions, I worry that my methodology behind concluding that the absolute value function cannot work, is flawed. One thing I can do to increase my confidence is to apply the same methodology to the square root function, which we know must work.

_Oh, right. This is my fantastic world._

So I wrote another program using the square root function. At first, I was disheartened to find it also outputted 0 possibilities—the methodology must be flawed, I thought. But actually, the problem was that I was simply squaring the dot products of perpendicular situations, _e.g._ $\braket{o|u}^2$, whereas I needed to be multiplying by the complex conjugate, _e.g._ $\braket{o|u}\braket{u|o}$.

<a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231126-mathematica">_This_</a> opened up the number of possibilities to **2,048**!

It's actually fortunate that I made the simple squaring mistake. If I had gotten 2,048 possibilities on the first try, I would have questioned my methodology for a second reason. Recovering from 0 to 2,048 essentially showed me that the magic was in the complex conjugate.

<!-- Next, I think I need to stand back and review all that's happened so far. I need to evaluate whether I should explore a third multivalued function, or accept that a third or even fourth multivalued function will not elucidate for me, the reason squaring-with-complex-conjugates is the multivalued function that works. Perhaps the secret requires a certain amount of knowledge in **group theory** or the broader **abstract algebra**, which I don't have. -->

<div class="journal">

  **Saturday.** Kimmy, Tina, and Joan are here. Squid Game is now a reality show? They brought a sour from Grimm—a _Gathering Cabernet Franc_ 👌.

</div>

Yesterday we further narrowed our possible choices to 128. Let's pick one from this set and try again:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{r}=&&\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{l}=&&\frac{i}{2}&\ket{u}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{o}=&&\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}-\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{i}=&&\frac{i}{2}&\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}
\end{alignat}$$

In column vector form:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\ket{r}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em}
&\ket{l}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ -\frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\ket{o}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em}
&\ket{i}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

We want to solve for $\sigma_x$:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ -\frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
-&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ -\frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

Wait, something's wrong with this one too.

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&+\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=&\frac{1}{2} \\\\
\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=&-\frac{i}{2}
\end{alignat}$$

Multiply the second equation by $i$ to get:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&+\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=\frac{1}{2} \\\\
-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&-\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=\frac{1}{2}
\end{alignat}$$

Then add the two equations:

$$0 = 1$$

$$\bot$$

No solution, once again. And I know why, and I'm an idiot. It wasn't just _duplicates_ and _negatives_ that were unsolvable. **_Any scalar multiples of one another_, including duplicates and negatives, were never going to work.** _That_ is the _real_ fourth criterion. A [Stack Overflow post](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/132348/6944) offers a way to detect that 2 vectors are scalar multiples of—or more concisely, _parallel_ to—one another. Updating the <a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231125-mathematica-2">code</a> to filter these out rather than just duplicates and negatives, the result?

**0 possibilities. There is no way to satisfy the four criteria using the absolute value function for our multivalued function.**

<h2>November 23 & 24, 2023</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Thursday.** Little Neck for Thanksgiving at my cousins'. We matched colors, pretended to be tourists at Grand Central, made the LIRR ticket inspector shuffle through 50 punched tickets because Abi wanted hers back as a souvenir, and stopped to look at trees. // **Friday.** I'm remembering, we'd also passed through Douglaston, where we could see the Tudor-style house I lived in in 1996, visible from the train. Back then—I was 8—I never knew, never wondered where this train came from or went. It was just a recurring sound that drowned out our voices while we played dodgeball in the parking lot. In that cul-de-sac also was a small, first-floor office outfitted as a "computer school" where I went to learn how to type. And it was living in that house that one day we found something strange in our mail—a red CD with a picture of a hat on it. We didn't have a computer and no one knew what the CD was for, but I was allowed to keep it, like a shiny rock. In 1998—I was 10—we finally got a personal computer and I put the CD in, but was disappointed when nothing happened. It was many years later—by then the CD was lost, both physically and from my memory—that I heard or read the words, _"Red Hat Linux"_. It's just crazy to think—someone in 1996 was going door to door dropping free CDs (which weren't cheap) in the mail, all in the name of open source software.

</div>

Anyway, last time we left off at discovering 288 possibilities of coefficients that pass [the three criteria](#20231116-criteria). Let's look at one of them:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{r}=&&\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{l}=&&-\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}-\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{o}=&&\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}-\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{i}=&&-\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}
\end{alignat}$$

I'm looking for a reason to invalidate that choice of coefficients, because I didn't expect the absolute value function to yield even 1 working possibility, let alone 288. Let's skip ahead to deriving **spin operators**. We rewrite the situations in column vector form:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\ket{r}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em}
&\ket{l}&=\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\ket{o}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em}
&\ket{i}&=\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

Let's start with $\ket{r}$ and $\ket{l}$. We want to solve for $\sigma_x$:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
-&\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

Take just the top rows:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&+\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&=\frac{1}{2} \\\\
-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&-\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&=\frac{1}{2}
\end{alignat}$$

Summing these equations lead to:

$$0 = 1$$

$$\bot$$

It turns out we need a fourth criterion: $\ket{r}\ne-\ket{l}$ and $\ket{o}\ne-\ket{i}$, or else you end up with a degenerate<sup>1</sup> system that can't be solved. Adding this to the <a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231125-mathematica">code</a>, we are down to **128** possibilities.

  Late **Sunday** night, sharing the desk and tea with Abi. She's creating an illustration for an editorial about hospital patients with excessive ER visits, and evaluating their housing situation as well as substance use or mental disorders so that social workers can get involved immediately, rather than defaulting to a diagnosis or operation the patients cannot afford. She's sketched some great ideas, like this one:

Anyway, on Friday we wanted to know: What are _all_ the alternate choices of coefficients for $\ket{l}$ that could lead to satisfying [the three criteria](#20231116-criteria)? I thought it'd be easier to just write a <a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231124-mathematica">program</a> that tries out all possibilities of coefficients for $\ket{r}$, $\ket{l}$, $\ket{o}$, and $\ket{i}$. Here's what it reveals:

1. Again, although there are infinite values in $\mathbb{C}$ whose absolute values are $\frac{1}{2}$ (the first criterion), for simplicity's sake, let's see if solutions exist that only use the values on the axes: \$\frac{1}{2}$, $-\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{i}{2}$, and $-\frac{i}{2}$. Combinatorically, this is choosing from 4 elements, 8 times (2 coefficients per situation), or 4<sup>8</sup>, which is **65,536** possibilities.

1. Of those, **4,096** pass the second criteria that $\braket{r|l}$ and $\braket{o|i}$ compute to zero.

1. Of those, **512** pass the third criteria that all "perpendicular" cases such as $\braket{r|o}$ and $\braket{r|i}$, including the cases involving $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$, compute to an absolute value of $\frac{1}{2}$.

1. Among those, I looked at some examples and noticed duplicates, _e.g._ $\ket{r}=\ket{l}=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}$. These pass the first criterion because of imaginary numbers multiplying to negatives. But they're clearly invalid since then those situations would be indistinguishable. Filtering them out, we're left with **288** possibilities.

I was quite surprised by this number. I was hoping for **0**—that way I could say, _"And this is why the absolute value function cannot be the multivalued function that fits."_ But instead, now we'll have to go further to see where using the absolute value function breaks down experimentally, if it does at all.

<div class="journal">

  **Friday.** At Amy's to help with a mouse problem; she's still somewhere in Europe.

</div>

The answer to yesterday's question is _no_—our particular formulation does _not_ meet "the third criteria," _i.e._ that $\braket{r|o}$ and $\braket{l|o}$ and $\braket{r|i}$ and $\braket{l|i}$ all yield 50% probabilities.

$$\begin{alignat}{5}
\braket{r|o}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{d|d}&&=\frac{i}{2}&\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\braket{l|o}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+(-\frac{1}{2})\frac{i}{2}\braket{d|d}&&=0&\not\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\braket{r|i}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+\frac{1}{2}(-\frac{i}{2})\braket{d|d}&&=\frac{i}{2}&\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\braket{l|i}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+(-\frac{1}{2})(-\frac{i}{2})\braket{d|d}&&=0&\not\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

What went wrong? It's simple. Algebraically,

$$\begin{alignedat}{3}
(\alpha\bra{u}+\alpha\bra{d})(\beta\ket{u}-\beta\ket{d})&=\alpha\beta\braket{u|u}&&-\alpha\beta\braket{u|d}\\\\
& &&+\alpha\beta\braket{d|u}-\alpha\beta\braket{d|d}\\\\
&=0
\end{alignedat}$$

Getting a zero this way was the desired effect for $\braket{r|l}$ and $\braket{o|i}$, but not for these perpendicular pairings. It's almost like programming now. What can we change so that for $\braket{l|o}$ and $\braket{l|i}$ the sign becomes positive but not for $\braket{l|u}$ and $\braket{l|d}$?

The choices are fewer than you'd think. In the classical style of proofs, let's make an assertion: Either $\ket{l}$ needs to change, or $\ket{o}$ and $\ket{i}$ need to change, or both. Right? They span the _entirety_ of options in our context.

Let's talk about $\ket{l}$ changing. Let's go all the way back to:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{r}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{l}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

What all could we even change $\ket{l}$ _to_? If we remain in the domain of complex numbers, the entirety of values that pass the "first criteria," _i.e._ their absolute values being $\frac{1}{2}$, _on_ the axes, are $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{i}{2}$, $-\frac{1}{2}$, and $-\frac{i}{2}$. (_Off_ the axes, all of the values on the continuous circle $\frac{1}{2}e^{i\theta}$ would pass. More on that later.)

<div class="journal">

  **Wednesday.** Rehearsal felt strangely nice—in brief moments we spoke like friends. I expressed appreciation to Mark for backing me up on the root notes of the verse of _Can't You See_. He smiled. // **Thursday.** No notes.

</div>

Let's continue where we left—seeing if we can find a suitable formula for $\ket{o}$ and $\ket{i}$ in terms of $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$, in the "absolute value world."

We can safely say we can't choose the same formulas that we did for $\ket{r}$ and $\ket{l}$. Neither $\ket{o}$ nor $\ket{i}$ should equal $\ket{r}$ or $\ket{l}$. And the following is not valid either:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{o}&=-\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{i}&=-\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

These are the same as $\ket{r}$ and $\ket{l}$, only looking at the world upside-down. What else can we possibly do to get coefficients with absolute values of $\frac{1}{2}$? Well, we can introduce complex numbers, _i.e._

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{o}&=\frac{i}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{i}&=\frac{i}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

<a name="20231116-criteria"></a>

This meets the first criteria: The absolute values of all these coefficients are $\frac{1}{2}$. It also meets the second criteria: $\braket{o|i}$ indeed computes to zero. Does it meet the third criteria, _i.e._ do $\braket{r|o}$ and $\braket{l|o}$ and $\braket{r|i}$ and $\braket{l|i}$ all yield 50% probabilities?

<h2>November 13, 2023</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Monday.** It's dawn at the start of a new week. Pausing to watch a red sunrise.

</div>

Let's continue where we left off yesterday—seeing what happens if we use the absolute value function for our multivalued function. We want to solve for $\ket{l}$:

$$\left(\bra{u}\frac{1}{2}+\bra{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)\ket{l}=0$$

Does this replacement work?

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\left(\bra{u}\frac{1}{2}+\bra{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\ket{u}\frac{1}{2}-\ket{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)&=\frac{1}{4}\braket{u|u}-\frac{1}{4}\braket{d|d}\\\\
&=\frac{1}{4}(1)-\frac{1}{4}(1)\\\\
&=0
\end{alignat}$$

It does! And so does the choice of

$$\left(-\ket{u}\frac{1}{2}+\ket{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)$$

I _think_ that that ambiguity maps to the ambiguity of up versus down. Whereas perhaps the square root's additional ambiguity maps to the ambiguity of $x$ vs. $z$ axes of orientation. We'll have a better guess shortly.

Now that we have the following...

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{r}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{l}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

...let's figure out $\ket{o}$ and $\ket{i}$. The probability of reading $+1$ versus $-1$ in the $\ket{u}$ orientation after setting up $\ket{o}$ is once again 50%-50%.

$$\begin{align}
\left|\braket{u|o}\right|=\frac{1}{2}\\\\
\left|\braket{d|o}\right|=\frac{1}{2}
\end{align}$$

<h2>November 12, 2023</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Sunday.** Just got back from grocery shopping with Abi. It's suddenly winter-y cold today, making it feel strangely cozy inside. She's making us enchiladas verdes while I write.

</div>

I wondered what the relationship was between the concept of **probability amplitudes** being defined as _square roots_ of probabilities and the fact that square roots are a multivalued function, therefore conveniently introducing a "degree of freedom" to whatever relation they're describing. **Can a different multivalued function be used to represent spin states? If not, what do square roots enable that other multivalued functions don't?**

For example, the _absolute value_ function. Mimicking Lecture 2, suppose we assert

$$\ket{A}=\alpha_u\ket{u}+\alpha_d\ket{d}$$

But instead of saying that $\alpha_u^*\alpha_u$ and $\alpha_d^*\alpha_d$ are the probabilities of measuring $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$, suppose it's $|\alpha_u|$ and $|\alpha_d|$. Then we can say one potential solution for $\ket{r}$ is

$$\ket{r}=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}$$

Next, to "fix" $\ket{l}$, we have no choice but to import the concept of bra-vectors. (I see—this is something I had left out until now.) We "know" that

$$\braket{r|l}=0$$

and so

$$\left(\bra{u}\frac{1}{2}+\bra{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)\ket{l}=0$$

Pause. What concepts did we begin with, and what concepts have we imported?

- We began with our own concept of "situations" notated $\ket{X}$ that act like **quantities**, _i.e._ can be added and multiplied to and with.
- We even began with the notation $\braket{Y|X}$ representing sort of a compound situation, pre-measurement.
- We did _not_ begin with the existence of the notation $\bra{Y}$. We've imported this along with the fact that, in this alternate system using the absolute value function, $\bra{Y}\equiv\ket{Y}$.
- And since the notation $\bra{Y}$ didn't even exist, we did _not_ begin with the fact that $\braket{Y|X}$ is simply a multiplication, $\bra{Y}\times\ket{X}$.

Okay! I think I have a better formulation of the original goal that will give rise to the algebra we're trying to assert:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>Given the symbols $\ket{u}$, $\ket{d}$, $\ket{r}$, $\ket{l}$, $\ket{o}$, $\ket{i}$ to represent <em>situations</em> (an orientation <em>and</em> measurement in a particular direction), and the symbols $\bra{u}$, $\bra{d}$, $\bra{r}$, $\bra{l}$, $\bra{o}$, $\bra{i}$ to mean a re-orientation in a particular direction (<em>without</em> measurement), can we invent an algebra in which these symbols can be treated as quantities (being addable, multipliable, etc.), and in which the multiplication of $\bra{y}\times\ket{x}$ not only represents the <em>situationship</em> $\braket{y|x}$ but conveniently <em>computes</em> to the probability of the situationship in that particular direction?</p>
</div>

Perfect—very happy with this.
