Sometimes I spend weeks thinking about a thing, and it may all have been good work, but with nothing to show for it, it can feel like a waste and bring me down. I've found that writing out at least some of the days of thought adds some pep to my step during the long droughts. Sometimes it even helps me break out when I'm going in circles.

<h2>Post-Singapore and getting off anti-depressants, 2024</h2>

<div class="journal">

  <span class="highlight">**Combining the past 6 weeks of posts into one because progress in physics slowed to only a few sentences a week, fragmenting my findings across too many posts.**</span>

  **Feb 14–17, Wed–Sat (Singapore).** A challenging few days nearing the end of the trip. But some highlights: Everyone—Chloe, Josh, Noelle, Betty, Felipe—individually beginning to interact with me more comfortably; making a friend at Swee Lee—Singapore's Guitar Center—Adam collects rare 7-strings—we'll meet up next time I visit Singapore; getting to see Abi's art—incredible.

  ![](../shared/assets/20240224-abi-art.jpeg)

  **Feb 18, Sun (Singapore).** 18-hour flight but not too bad. Finished _Whereabouts_ by Jhumpa Lahiri. Read a good chunk of _Doppelganger_ by Naomi Klein—_diagonalism_ is a really useful term. Loving the Super Mario RPG remake. // **Feb 19, Mon (US).** Home. // **Feb 24, Sat.** Abi's at Xun's. Later she'll join me to see Cande's partner Will DJ with Volen Sentir not too far from our place. // **Mar 1, Fri.** Yesterday the band got together for the first time this year. Brian got engaged in Europe, Nick had a baby (Lola), I was in Singapore. But meanwhile _Falling_ crossed 100,000 listens on Spotify and [the music video's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVIgVHcCuKg) at 24,000. Phantom crossed 10,000 on both listens and [the music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fcu8lkhNoZA). We blew up in Indonesia and doubled since the new year to 13,000 monthly listeners.

  ![](../shared/assets/20240302-haunting-ghosts.png)

  **Mar 2, Sat.** Kathleen's coming down from upstate today. I'm excited to catch up—we haven't really since Fall two years ago. Abi and Kimmy are joining us too for climbing and dinner at Lilia. // **Mar 13, Wed.** Dynaco with Amy while she's briefly in NYC. // **Mar 14, Thu.** Day 9 of ramping off Wellbutrin. I have trouble remembering that "physics" exists. // **Mar 20, Wed.** Day 15. I know I can't just keep waiting to "feel like" doing something—I need to try by force—I need to get used to a new baseline for what "being motivated" feels like—but... I can't seem to lift a finger. // Still, managed to meet up with Yee—he's in town for the Reddit IPO. // **Mar 24, Sun.** Day 18. Re-united with Jaclyn yesterday—a penpal and close friend from 15 years ago. Today, a day in NJ with Abi &amp; family. // **Mar 31, Sun.** Day 22. I finally feel like trying again. Those 3 weeks felt like months, holy shit.

Let's continue our exploration of language, and start tuning it in.

- A $\textrm{1c/1s-1t}$ depicts a **1-cloud** of **events** on a line.
    - A 1-cloud may go by the vernacular, **curve**.
    - The previously explored terms ~**rigid**~ and ~**curvy**~ aren't particularly useful. The former is just an extreme degree of the latter. But it may be useful to note that the degree of the latter may be measurable in fractional dimensions, which pedantically might be notated with decimals, _e.g._ $\textrm{1.2c/1s-1t}$.
    - A more useful set of classifiers for curves may be **functional** versus **non-functional** with respect to time. A functional 1-cloud of events might be called a **trail**. The non-functional kind is foreign to our human experience and thus probably devoid of any helpful vernacular.
    - Let's say our notation defaults to functional curves, and the notation for non-functional ones are like $\textrm{1c*/1s-1t}$.
    - But note how, were we to look at things with respect to $u$-time, the non-functional could become functional, and the term "trail" fits again.
    - Non-sequitor. Implicitly we appear to assume **continuity** of curves, perhaps all clouds. <em>Dis</em>-continuity may exist only in **projections** or **timescans** (PoCT).

- A $\textrm{2c/1s-1t}$ depicts a 2-cloud of events on a plane.

    - Is this automatically non-functional?
    - Recall that we primarily mean to talk about **point-particles**, not **bodies of particles**.
    - But why didn't we have this struggle with the 1-cloud, which also could have been mistaken for a body of particles?
    - No, we did. That's exactly why we called it a "trail," to dispel the notion that the point-particle exists at any point other than the latest.
    - Where is the "latest" in the 2-cloud?
    - For that matter, where is the "latest" in the 1-cloud?
        - It's determined by the subjective **direction** of the time dimension.
        - I'm
    - ---
    -
    - ---
    - Oh, interesting, this one is automatically non-functional.
    - next: oh... as potential events this seems functional to me, only not if it forces a curving back to "reach" some areas. so maybe f/nf needs to be redefined. also need to think about the nature of this body... is it more like... a lattice? of all the ways to get from one place to another. but if you are in some location, it doesn't guarantee you can get to another. ohhhh maybe... the blob... is where a point-particle _can_ reach from where it is now


location = projection of event onto space

eh?
- path
nope
- events


New thoughts come to mind:

- Something feels qualitatively different the moment a curve "curls back," yielding a multiplicity of **locations** _per time_. This is not so when time is uninvolved—there it just feels like, truly, a cloud of locations.
- [Rethink graphical rep versus real body...]
- "is the curling back where fractalness begins? i.e. is it never above 1.0 as long as it's monotonic?"
- **path** vs **trail**: path only makes sense on a projection in the time domain (?) so can _appear_ as multiple locations in 1 time, but no, it's a projection; a trail meanwhile... well, a hiking trail is like a path, but i mean like a "trailing" trail, which is exactly related to the "timelapse" word, and it could actually go backwards in time too, thereby having 2 locations at one time, but ohhhhhhhh it's continuity that matters here
- discontinuity is only possible via higher dimension
- point-particle when talking about a thing, location when about... hm ... then events and configurations


- There's an assumption of continuity.

struck down
- displacement
- point => location
- n-span => n-cloud
- rigid vs. curvy => fractional dimensions
- line (doesn't exist in nature), area, volume => curve, surface, blob/cloud
- 2c/3s-1t => TODO
- tuples
keeping
- visual extrapolation ~= timelapse ~= ! physically isomorphic representation ~= ! simultaneous existence at every location ~= graph representation
- curve (?)
- (s, t)-space
- n-cloud of locations
debating
- path vs trail - done
- point-particle
- valid/possible pairings between x & y, due to some constraint
- potential/access
- locations a point-particle can occupy
- (non-)functional
- contiuity
- branching
- neighborhoods
- n-cloud of events
- n-cloud of configurations
asdf
- "we imprecisely say" <-- reiterate! oh i did. add more context!

seems important to distinguish **functiontal** vs. **non-functional** clouds, _i.e._

I seem to be stuck here. I feel a subtle difference between "possible" and "potential," leaning toward the latter for some reason related to time. And similar between "locations," "events," and "configurations." Consider these in conjunction:

- A $\textrm{2c/2s}$ depicts a 2-cloud of ... ?
- A $\textrm{2c/2s-1t}$ depicts a 2-cloud of ... ?

path - a d-cloud that stays function wrt time dimension(s)
point-particle -
area = rigid surface
line = rigid curve
volume = rigid space (because non-rigid space would look like separate volumes i think)



And continuing:

- A $\textrm{2c/1s-1t}$ depicts a 2-cloud of valid **possible** locations.

Why did the word "possible" surface again? Ah, I think I know—I think it's our space-bias. We recognize multiple locations in space _over time_ as **movement**—a **path**. But we don't commonly imagine multiple locations in space _at the same time_. This kind of simultaneous existence feels more like an _alternate reality_ to us. Re-say the very first one this way:

- A $\textrm{1c/1s-1t}$ depicts a 1-cloud of valid **possible** locations.

Once the map of time (domain) to space (codomain) becomes non-functional, our language almost naturally seems to invent the concept of parallel timelines.

In a way. In a way.

Next time, let's continue onto 3 dimensions.

<h2>February 10, 11, 12 & 13, 2024</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Saturday (Singapore).** Despite the pre-jetlagging, this the first morning I've been able to wake up at or before dawn. The humidity and heat here isn't as unbearable as I braced for. Yesterday I took Abi's family to lunch on behalf of my family; they watched us boulder for a bit. Later Abi's grandmother came over. // **Sunday (Singapore).** 16 coffees with a manual grinder and an Aeropress, smh—but, it worked out in the end. I met some of Abi's cousins; Nick was kind. // **Monday (Singapore).** Yesterday Abi and I walked through Arab St. and Little India and stopped at a cat cafe. Today's the day I've been warned about—the "40-person family day"—but I feel okay 🤞. // **Tuesday (Singapore).** Nono loves playing in the swimming pool.

</div>

<!-- I'm going to look for an opportunity to chat with Uncle Ste(v|ph)en and Uncle Melvin—I only got to chat with Uncle Darr(en|yl) on Saturday. For some reason I feel it improper to approach the Aunties—I wonder why. But I hope they'll talk to me. Maybe I'll get Nick's number too—he offered to show me around Meta's office later this week.-->

Anyway, back to dimensionality. Last time, I said this:

<blockquote>We imprecisely say that the possible locations of a point-particle are <em>here</em> and <em>there</em>, but without a time component, neither <em>here</em> nor <em>there</em> are precise locations to even say a particle has been or will be.</blockquote>

This brings me back to a paradox I've never resolved. Envisioning space down-dimensioned as the 2-surface of a sphere whose radial dimension is time, I imagined the expansion of that sphere being responsible for moving us "forward in time." But how can I say _moving_? (Take a moment to perceive what's wrong with that.) To _move_ is to _change location "over time"_, but if time is _part_ of the location $(x_0, y_0, t_0)$ then over what "time" does the location change to another, $(x_1, y_1, t_1)$? It must be another _kind_ of time—I've heard it called _kime_—but I prefer to call it $u$-time. This forces us to consider: Do we _move_ through $u$-time, necessitating a $v$-time, _ad infinitum_? Or is there a count of dimensions at which nothing moves? But how does _change_ happen if nothing moves? Ah, I think I see. **To model time as a spatial dimension, we _must_ be able to explain _change_—either by introducing a _higher_ time dimension, or by offering a theory of how _we've_ come to be able to perceive change, despite inhabiting an unchanging, static universe.**

There's nothing impossible about the universe being infinitely dimensioned—in fact in some ways, it's stranger to think it'd be finite and specifically numbered. But then why do the first 3 dimensions feel so qualitatively different from the time dimension(s)? Well, that could just be that our sensory organs developed that way.

The latter possibility is more intriguing. How can a _perception_ of change arise from within a structure that doesn't change? The answer may be that it can't. But if it _could_, then it teases a physical realization of the universe as a high-dimensional fractal.

Both seem possible to me. To consider future ideas in both contexts, let's name them the **infinite time theory (ITT)** and the **perception-of-change theory (PoCT)**.

More can be said about PoCT. Whatever the "perceiving" mechanism is, it must be something like a scanner "reading" the static universe slice by slice—in our case, 3-slice by 3-slice. Then, a point-particle _in 3-space_ would actually be a **body** of particles—an actual curve through time (_i.e._ not only a graph representation)—because otherwise the point-particle would exist only at a particular time, and disappear, instantaneously.

One more disjointed thought. Going back to the 3-surfaced radial-time 4-sphere model, I realize now that I've always "felt" a sense of time that _wasn't_ $t$. In fact what was happening was, I was perceiving $u$-time _via_ my sense of _motion_. Is motion a human-friendly way to "visualize" an extra dimension? (For example, I never found color gradients particularly intuitive.) That would be quite useful if the case—something for our toolbox to try using later.

<h2>February 3, 4, 5 & 6, 2024</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Saturday.** Leaving for Singapore tomorrow; we've been pre-jetlagging ourselves pretty successfully. // **Sunday (Germany).** Connecting in Frankfurt to sleep in a bed; they can't find our checked bags; nothing we can do for now. // **Monday (Germany).** They say our bags should have forwarded despite the non-normal connection. 🤞 // **Tuesday (Singapore).** They did! Abi's parents Betty and Felipe picked us up and we went to Abi's sister's (Chloe, Josh, and baby Noel) to have dinner.

</div>

Here's some sporadic progress made over that timeframe.

Previously we explored a lot of language. That will continue here. Let's review some of our invented terms:

- A $\textrm{1c/1s-1t}$ (a "path") depicts a 1-cloud of events on a line.

Q: Can this path be curvy? Or does curviness make it a $\textrm{2c/1s-1t}$? Recall our original attempt to define rigidity and curviness, substituting **span** for **cloud**:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    Basically, for any <i>n</i>-span in <i>m</i>-space, if <i>n = m</i>, then the span is a <b>rigid span</b>; while if <i>n < m</i>, the span <em>can</em> be a <b>curvy span</b> in any number of dimensions up to <i>m-1</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe the terms <b>line</b>, <b>area</b>, and <b>volume</b> stand for the rigid spans, while the terms <b>curve</b>, <b>surface</b>, and <b>?</b> stand for the curvy spans.
  </p>
</div>

There we seem to have been saying that a curve would still be a $\textrm{1c/1s-1t}$. But there's an alternative answer that resonates with me—A: A curve is **fractionally dimensioned** between 1.0 and 2.0, rigid at 1.0, and space-filling and equivalent to a rigid area at 2.0.

I want to denote this with $\textrm{1.xc/1s-1t}$, but I'm not sure how fractional dimensions work when a curve is non-space-filling but curving in skip-dimensions, _e.g._ coiled in 3 dimensions.

- A $\textrm{2c/1s-1t}$ depicts a 2-cloud of ... ?

I seem to be stuck here. I feel a subtle difference between "possible" and "potential," leaning toward the latter for some reason related to time. And similar between "locations," "events," and "configurations." Consider these in conjunction:

- A $\textrm{2c/2s}$ depicts a 2-cloud of ... ?
- A $\textrm{2c/2s-1t}$ depicts a 2-cloud of ... ?

I truly don't understand why, but to me "possible locations" feel like locations I can **access** _at any time_, while "potential locations" feels like locations I can access _at a specific time_ (whether past or future). Why did the word "access" come up? It's a bit circular, because the notion of "possible" or "potential" is embedded within it. But it came up because I was picturing myself putting a pin on a specific location and asking myself, _"Can I put a pin here?"_ It'd be less circular to say, rather than locations I can access, **locations a point-particle can be**—at any time versus at a specific time.

It may simply have to do with each word's common usage. On a human level, I can go to church and back, saying they are both _possible_ locations that I can "access" at any time. On a particle(s) level, our entire solar system is flinging across space (toward the Great Attractor) at over 1.3 million miles an hour—there is no Earth in the location in the void we've left behind—there's no going back home. So, a $2c/2s$ _seems_ like a 2-cloud of _possible locations_ (irrespective of time), but only on a human level. We imprecisely say that the possible locations of a point-particle are _here_ and _there_, but without a time component, neither _here_ nor _there_ are precise locations to even say a particle has been or will be.

There's something imprecise about what I've just said. I'll unpack it next time.

<h2>January 27, 28, & 31 2024</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Sunday.** Went to see Wata Igarishi (techno) on Friday—I really needed that, after weeks of waking up at dawn to write RFCs. It was good to catch up with Lotus at Honey's (still serving Daggers<sup>†††</sup>); ran into Amar in the line; and later Fallon—who for some reason I always feel some kind of wholesome joy to see; and I saw Kiko in the distance too but felt shy to say hi. // **Saturday.** Amy had an extra ticket to Dirty Circus at House of Yes—we were both blown away, wow—highly recommend. // **Wednesday.** Just coming back from Ensenada with Abi, Amy, and Kathy. Amy's last day here before she's in Mexico for 6 weeks. Phi just finished moving into Amy's. Kathy's just moved into her friend's. So much changing.

</div>

Not me though. So anyway, we left off at wanting to investigate dimensional analogues—particularly my misuse of them. I think I've been thrown off all this time by traditional graphs of **displacement** over time, which are not depictions of anything _as it exists_, but rather more like a _timelapse_ of it. To say it more boldly, _any illustration other than a **point** is an **visual extrapolation**, not a **physically isomorphic representation**_. Unless we're specifically talking about a **body** of many points. **(This post is going to use a _lot_ of quoting and bolding and emphasis, because I'm actively searching for new language).** So for example, a **curve** (to use a more general term for a line) on the $(x, t)$ plane depicts the $x$ displacement of a thing over time. Meanwhile, a curve on the $(x, y)$ plane invites different words: We might say it depicts a relationship between a thing's $x$ and $y$ displacements, caused perhaps by some kind of constraint. (The difference might have more to do with our natural sense of time, which always moves in one direction.) But anyway, in either case, the point is that the curve doesn't mean **simultaneous existence** at every point on the curve.

Let's try making up some terminology to classify things:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    Let's write <b><i>n</i>-span</b> to mean an <i>n</i>-dimensional connected subset of an <i>n-or-more</i>-dimensional space. This is an overly complicated way to say that a <b>1-span</b> is a curve, a <b>2-span</b> is an area, a <b>3-span</b> is a volume, and so forth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's write <b><i>(s, t)</i>-space</b> to mean an <i>s+t</i>-dimensional space with <i>s</i> spatial dimensions and <i>t</i> temporal dimensions. So, <b>(3, 1)-space</b> is the popularly known world we live in.
  </p>
</div>

By the way, do I _actually_ think space and time are different "kinds" of dimensions? Yes and no. For one thing, time certainly _feels_ distinct from space, in that our experience of "movement" in time has only gone in one direction ever. So it could be fair to treat them as distinct, _e.g._ in order to better highlight pitfalls that may rise from _not_ thinking about time as we would normally about space. But more "objectively" even, there _may_ be a real fact behind _why_ masses move or interact differently in certain dimensions, _e.g._ perhaps we _can_ move in the other direction of time, but some overwhelming constraint prevents that, at least as far as our instruments can detect.

Now some remarks about the relationship between spans and spaces:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    A 1-span in 1-space is still a "curve," but not a <em>curvy</em> curve, because it is restricted to 1-space. The 1-span in 2-space however can properly be <em>curvy</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's the same deal with 2-spans in 2-space versus 3-space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Basically, for any <i>n</i>-span in <i>m</i>-space, if <i>n = m</i>, then the span is a <b>rigid span</b>; while if <i>n < m</i>, the span <em>can</em> be a <b>curvy span</b> in any number of dimensions up to <i>m-1</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe the terms <b>line</b>, <b>area</b>, and <b>volume</b> stand for the rigid spans, while the terms <b>curve</b>, <b>surface</b>, and <b>?</b> stand for the curvy spans.
  </p>
</div>

And finally, some shorthand:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    When speaking of, for example, a 2-span in <i>(3, 1)</i>-space, we may notate it: $$\textrm{2c/3s-1t}$$
  </p>
</div>

Let's use our new words to re-say what we've already said. **I'm still exploring terminology, so continue to bear with me through all the bold text.**

- A $\textrm{1c/1s-1t}$ depicts the **path** of a **point-particle** over time.
- A $\textrm{1c/2s}$ depicts **valid** or **possible** **pairings** between the $x$ and $y$ **positions** of a point-particle, due to some **constraint**.

It's notable that the relationships are not necessarily **functional**—imagine a circle, a sine wave, a spiral. Though, there seems to be something significant about **continuity** and **non-branching** that contributes to our perception of a "curve." I want to rephrase that in terms of $\epsilon$-radius **neighborhoods** but it's a bit tricky and not the main point here; let's move on.

- A $\textrm{2c/2s}$ (a rigid span) depicts an area of valid or possible pairings between the $x$ and $y$ positions of a point-particle, due to some constraint.

We desperately need some shorthand for that:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    Instead of saying, <i>"a curve (or surface, or ?) of valid or possible pairings (or <b>tuples</b>) between the $x$ ($y$, $z$, ...) positions of a point-particle, due to some constraint,"</i> we will say an <b><i>n</i>-cloud of locations</b>, or an <b><i>n</i>-cloud of events</b> if a time dimension is involved, or perhaps an <b><i>n</i>-cloud of configurations</b> in general, where <i>n</i> stands for the number of dimensions each relationship binds, <i>e.g.</i> as <i>n</i>-tuples.
  </p>
</div>

There was more said here, but I am reorganizing them in a future post.

<!--
  I can think of a strategy that might help me avoid this pitfall: I should draw curves now on using dotted lines, and maybe emphasize a specific position on the curve using a bold point.
-->

 <!-- The 1-dimensional $s$ doesn't lend itself to 360 degrees of directions, at least not in a way I understand. So I would prefer to do my thinking with at least a 2-dimensional $s$. But how do I visualize $(s_x, s_y, t, u)$? I think a traditional technique is to use colors. Which dimension becomes colors then? -->

<!-- This might be some of the most important thinking I've done in my life. I'm (over)excited to clarify aspects of dimensional analogizing that I've always been confused by. Next let's kick it up a dimension.

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    Now add a 3rd dimension, $(x, y, z)$. This space supports 3 types of entities. The first two are exactly the same as for $(x, y)$—point particles and <b>representational curves</b>, we'll call them. The third would be <b>representational surfaces</b>—essentially the same thing.
  </p>
</div>

It appears to be too difficult for me to imagine what a surface in $(x, y, t)$ means. I'll skip this for now. The major takeaway is that what's <em>real</em>, is still the point particle, nothing else.

Okay, but how did we get here from talking about colors?

<div class="declaration">
  <p>
    For a <em>point particle</em> in $(x, y)$, adding a colored spatial dimension $z$ can show the "elevation" of that particle; adding a colored temporal dimension $t$ can show whether its position was in a relative past or relative future. These aren't useful to us at all of course, since a 3-dimensional $(x, y, z)$ or $(x, y, t)$ are far easier to see the same thing with.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a <em>representational curve</em> in $(x, y)$, adding a colored <em>temporal</em> dimension $t$, is very difficult to imagine conceptually; adding a colored <em>spatial</em> dimension $y$ to $(x, t)$ is much easier. This style of representation highlights <em>motion</em> in a primary spatial dimension while backgrounding a secondary spatial dimension.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's also possible to plot a <em>surface</em> in $(x, y)$ using color to indicate elevation again (creating a topographic map) or to indicate time (but this is quite difficult to imagine conceptually as well). But note that now we're talking about bodies of particles
  <p>
    For a <em>point particle</em> in $(x, y)$, adding a colored spatial dimension $z$ can show the "elevation"

This past weekend I began to revive the tether theory (T3). It's more urgent than learning quantum mechanics or finding a visual presentation of the incompleteness theorem or anything else I'm doing.

In particular, I want to think about what it means to "move" a $\Delta u$ in the $(s, t, u)$ hyperspace. Drawing out an example already clarified several things for me:

![](../shared/assets/20240221-t3-stu.png)

Notice in the 1-dimensional representation of $s$, only 2 directions are possible, $\Delta s$ and $-\Delta s$. And $t$ is an axis, so this is a **static frame**, a term I use to remind myself that there's _no concept of motion_. I can see that...

 1. it was never a necessity that all possible $\Delta s$ were represented in the neighborhood of $\Delta u$—from any displacement of $s$, any $\Delta s$ is valid—

 1. which means $(s, t)$-slices of $(s, t, u)$ _can_ exist as duplicates—there's no uniqueness constraint—and

 1. which also means not all possible $(s, t)$-slices _have_ to exist!

This means my so-far-persistent imagination that in 2,3-space $\Delta u$ must cover all $\Delta\theta$ and $\Delta\phi$, was unnecessary! The _only_ constraint is that $\Delta s$ is continuous over $\Delta u$, whichever potential direction it goes within its dimension(s).

<!-- By the way, a minor thing to point out about that drawing. It wasn't necessary either for the displacement in $s$ to be the same across $u$. They would almost always be varied. -->

I've always felt that my grasp of dimensional analogues was disorganized and inconsistent. Next time I'd like to focus on that, and maybe clarify the subject for myself once and for all.

  **Monday.** Caught COVID for the 3rd time but on the upswing, maybe—it's so non-linear with this virus. // There was a sharp crescent in the red-orange horizon, and right by it an exceedingly bright star though no other stars were visible. It turned out to be Venus. I didn't know it was possible to see a planet at dawn, and it made me grateful. For 30+ years I was too mentally ill to notice the sky (what a privilege to be able to notice the world), until I met the therapist and doctor I did and started on the meds I'm currently on, 3 years ago.

Back to writing _"b is a power of 2"_ in TNT. I think I want to say, _"For all factors f of b, f should be equal to 2."_ So:

- $\forall{f}\in\mathbb{N}:\forall{g}\in\mathbb{N}:(f\cdot g=b)\supset(f=SS0)$

Big convolution theorem vibes, writing $f$ and $g$ like that.

  **Tuesday.** NYE was nice. Abi's many friends came over. Taylor hung out through the night, and Amy, Andrew, and Cande stopped by.

</div>

Today I'm reviewing _Godel, Escher, Bach_ to understand the TNT construction of Godel's incompleteness theorem, so that I can start wondering about alternate, visual constructions.

1. Page 181. "The Propositional Calculus." Here _GEB_ introduces propositional logic using a limited set of symbols. I like that it says **the fantasy rule** instead of an **assumption**.

1. Page 204. "Typographical Number Theory." Here _GEB_ introduces zero and successors (_e.g._ **SSS0**), variables (_e.g._ **a``**), and addition and multiplication, and merges in what we'd learned about propositional logic. Some worthwhile exercises on page 215. Then the Five Peano Postulates. Then **specification** and **generalization**. A light introduction to $\omega$-inconsistency. Then **induction**. Then a long, sample proof of the commutativity of addition in TNT.

1. Page 261. "Mumon and Godel." In the middle of this chapter, _GEB_ introduces a numbering system for **MIU**, then demonstrates the relationship between typographic operations and arithmetic. (This is a good reference to think about the need for exponents and modulo.) Then **producible numbers** and **recursively enumerable sets**. Okay, here's where my grasp starts to unravel, so let me engage more deeply and solve some of the exercises.

Exercises

- _"All natural numbers are equal to 4."_
    - $\forall{a}\in\mathbb{N}:a=SSSS0$
- _"There is no natural number which equals its own square."_
    - $\neg\exists{a}\in\mathbb{N}:a=a\cdot a$
- _"Different natural numbers have different successors."_
    - $\forall{a}\in\mathbb{N}:\forall{b}\in\mathbb{N}:\neg(a=b)\supset\neg(Sa=Sb)$
- _"If 1 equals 0, then every number is odd."_
    - $(1=0)\supset(\forall{a}\in\mathbb{N}:\exists{b}:SS0\cdot b=a)$
- _"b is a power of 2."_
    - (To be continued.)

  **Monday.** _"Take your credit and sit down!"_ 🤣

</div>

Yesterday, we quickly found that no solution exists for
$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix*}[r]50\\% \\\\ 100\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&=\alpha_u\begin{bmatrix*}[r]100\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&&+\alpha_d\begin{bmatrix*}[r]0\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}
\end{alignat}$$

Next we wondered how (and why) the complex domain and representing probabilities as their square roots might help. First let's rewrite the percentages as decimals—this is the same equation that has no solution:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}&=\alpha_u\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ \frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}&&+\alpha_d\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ \frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

Here's a fleeting but key idea, I think: In _QMTTM_, $\ket{r}$ alone doesn't contain the entire situationship. Multiplying it with $\bra{u}$ eliminates the $\alpha_d$ term and leaves $\alpha_u$, which _wholly_ and _only_ contains the probability amplitude. Contrast that to our setup, where $\ket{r}$ contains the entire situationship by itself, and the $\alpha$ coefficients serve to massage $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$'s situationships into $\ket{r}$'s.

So I wonder two things. (1) Was there even a valid rationale behind setting up a linear equation of the same form, when the nature of the ket vectors were completely different? (2) If we entertain that possibility, then have we "transferred" probability information from the coefficients to the ket vectors? (Then what information do the coefficients represent?)

<div class="journal">

  **Sunday.** Later today we're going to Hey Yuet for Kaz's birthday. // Back and continuing. Abi's watching Game of Thrones on the couch.

</div>

I want to outline where I'm headed next with this article:

1. Introduce the bra-ket notation using $\braket{u|r}$.
1. Restate that $\braket{u|r}$ is 50-50.
1. State that $\braket{d|r}$ is equivalent, though swapped.
1. Extend to $\braket{o|r}$ and $\braket{i|r}$.
1. Extend to $\braket{r|r}$ and $\braket{l|r}$.
1. Point out redundance of the probability of $-1$. 𝒜 can only measure $+1$ or $-1$ so there's no situation where you'd find probabilities not summing to 100%.
1. Assert $\ket{r}$'s set of probabilities as its **situationship**—the property we've been looking for—temporaneously notated $\\{50\\%, 50\\%, 100\\%, 0\\%, 50\\%, 50\\%\\}$—then write out all 6 situations' situationships.
1. Point out redundance of considering $\braket{d|r}$, $\braket{i|r}$, and $\braket{l|r}$, compacting the notation to $\\{50\\%, 100\\%, 50\\%\\}$, etc. for all 6 situations' situationships.
1. Then we can consider the algebra:
$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\ket{r}&=\alpha_u\ket{u}&&+\alpha_d\ket{d}\\\\
\\{50\\%, 100\\%, 50\\%\\}&=\alpha_u\\{100\\%, 50\\%, 50\\%\\}&&+\alpha_d\\{0\\%, 50\\%, 50\\%\\}
\end{alignat}$$

Great. Now I can look ahead exploratively, before spending time writing up all of the above. Suppose we interpreted situationships as column vectors:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix*}[r]50\\% \\\\ 100\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&=\alpha_u\begin{bmatrix*}[r]100\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}&&+\alpha_d\begin{bmatrix*}[r]0\\% \\\\ 50\\% \\\\ 50\\%\end{bmatrix*}
\end{alignat}$$

That would force $\alpha_u=\frac{1}{2}$ but then $\alpha_d$ must be $\frac{3}{2}$ to satisfy the middle row or also $\frac{1}{2}$ to satisfy the bottom row. So there appears to be no solution.

Let's be creative though. How might the complex domain help? How might representing probabilities as their square roots help? The two have to work together—the squaring of a complex number is where its power lies.

<div class="journal">

  **Sunday.** Impenetrable grey.

</div>

Where was I headed, that it seemed advantageous to define a "situationship" as a set of probabilities of measuring in all directions, rather than just one? ... Ah right—I was aiming to show that 2 probabilities were sufficient—and that those probabilities might as well be the ones associated with $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$. But how could I not have noticed such a glaring error? It's not an attribute of $\braket{r|u}$ that's a situationship; it's $\ket{u}$. So:

$$\ket{u}=\\{50\\%, 50\\%, 100\\%\\}$$

<h2>December 2 & 3, 2023</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Saturday.** Just getting home from shooting a music video. It was more demanding than I expected—7 back-to-back takes with a short break in the middle. But it also went smoother than I expected, with Vlad's prep and experience and everyone in the band showing up early and being helpful. // **Sunday.** Can't move my neck this morning.

</div>

21 days ago, we formulated the following question:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>Given the symbols $\ket{u}$, $\ket{d}$, $\ket{r}$, $\ket{l}$, $\ket{o}$, $\ket{i}$ to represent <em>situations</em> (an orientation <em>and</em> measurement in a particular direction), and the symbols $\bra{u}$, $\bra{d}$, $\bra{r}$, $\bra{l}$, $\bra{o}$, $\bra{i}$ to mean a re-orientation in a particular direction (<em>without</em> measurement), can we invent an algebra in which these symbols can be treated as quantities (being addable, multipliable, etc.), and in which the multiplication of $\bra{y}\times\ket{x}$ not only represents the <em>situationship</em> $\braket{y|x}$ but conveniently <em>computes</em> to the probability of the situationship in that particular direction?</p>
</div>

But I think it could use some more clarification. The "quantities" are of an unknown kind—an unknown _dimension_. We ourselves assert that the dimensionality of $\braket{x|y}$ is a probability (or some function thereof)—the probability of reading $\ket{x}$ in the next measurement. It almost seems like a neat trick that by that definition and experimentally, we know that $\braket{x|x}=1$ and $\braket{x|\bar{x}}=0$.

But why did we bring up the concept of multivalued functions? Right—we wondered if they were being used as a mechanism to allow 2 distinct situations to share the same situationship, _i.e._ both $\braket{u|r}$ and $\braket{u|o}$ compute to a 50% probability of measuring $\ket{u}$, but are different situations.

We found though that we could not recreate a working setup with the absolute value function over the real domain. When we tried with the squaring function over the complex domain, at first we also found 0 working setups. But in that attempt we had not used complex conjugates, which when introduced did lead to 2,048 working setups.

I think it's time to wrap up this arc. I had hoped to understand _why_ complex numbers, _why_ complex conjugation, _why_ probability "amplitudes," etc., but I feel I keep running into the doors of abstract algebra, which are locked and inaccessible to me at this time. I think I'm not ready to understand this part yet. And we haven't even gotten to generalizing the whole thing for arbitrary directions $\theta$ and $\phi$, which might even hold a clue about _why the squaring function_ (its relation to circles).

But here's a thing I kept wondering through this entire arc. _Had_ we been able to prove that no other multivalued function and algebraic setup could have met all the criteria and still produced a working setup, is that _why_ things are the way they are? I mean: Do we live in a universe that works this way _because_ no other physical setup is possible, because physical setups are a subset of algebraic setups, and we'd (hypothetically) found only one algebraic setup that works?

On Tuesday we stumbled upon **Pauli matrices** when we computed the spin operators for 1 of our 2,048 possibilities. Was it chance, or do all possibilities lead to Pauli matrices?

Excluding duplicates (ignoring ordering), there appear to be **4** distinct sets of "Pauli" matrices:

$\mathcal{P}_1$ is the one used in QMTTM. My guess about there being 4 variants is that relative to a fixed up vs. down orientation on the z-axis, you can flip the x-axis, flip the y-axes, or flip both.

<div class="journal">

  **Tuesday.** Met Amy and some coworkers at Metrorock Bushwick tonight. First time climbing in months—felt unexpectedly nice.

</div>

We left off at discovering 2,048 possible sets of coefficients using the square root as our multivalued function. We didn't yet attempt to create spin operators for any of them. It's tedious to keep doing that by hand though, so let's write a program.

In a first pass, I expand out the system of linear equations, _i.e._ from

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
&\begin{bmatrix}xa & xb \\\\ xc & xd\end{bmatrix}\ket{r} &&= &\ket{r} \\\\
&\begin{bmatrix}xa & xb \\\\ xc & xd\end{bmatrix}\ket{l} &&= -&\ket{l}
\end{alignat}$$

to

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
xa\ket{r}_1 &+ xb\ket{r}_2 &&= &\ket{r}_1 \\\\
xc\ket{r}_1 &+ xd\ket{r}_2 &&= &\ket{r}_2 \\\\
xa\ket{l}_1 &+ xb\ket{l}_2 &&= -&\ket{l}_1 \\\\
xc\ket{l}_1 &+ xd\ket{l}_2 &&= -&\ket{l}_2 \\\\
\end{alignat}$$

and using `Solve`:

<pre><code class="language-mathematica">
sigmaX = Solve[
  xa * r[[1]] + xb * r[[2]] == r[[1]] &&
  xa * l[[1]] + xb * l[[2]] == -l[[1]] &&
  xc * r[[1]] + xd * r[[2]] == r[[2]] &&
  xc * l[[1]] + xd * l[[2]] == -l[[2]],
  Flatten[{{xa, xb}, {xc, xd}}]
]

(*
  {{xa -> 0, xb -> -I, xc -> I, xd -> 0}}
  {{ya -> 0, yb -> 1, yc -> 1, yd -> 0}}
*)
</code></pre>

In a second pass, I use the intended language for these purposes, _i.e._ matrices, vectors, and dot products:

<pre><code class="language-mathematica">
sx = {{sx11, sx12}, {sx21, sx22}};
sxSolved = Solve[sx.r == r && sx.l == -l, Flatten[sx]]

(* {{sx11 -> 0, sx12 -> -1, sx21 -> -1, sx22 -> 0}} *)

sxSolvedMatrix = ArrayReshape[sxSolved[[1, All, 2]], {2, 2}]

(* {{0, -1}, {-1, 0}} *)
</code></pre>

Finally, packaging the above into a function, we can compute the 3 spin operators—$\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, $\sigma_z$—for just 1 of the 2,048 possibilities. The result:

<pre><code class="language-mathematica">{{{0, -I}, {I, 0}}, {{0, 1}, {1, 0}}, {{1, 0}, {0, -1}}}
</code></pre>

Formatted:

$$\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}0 & -i \\\\ i & 0\end{bmatrix}\hspace{2em}\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}\hspace{2em}\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}$$

Exactly the **Pauli matrices**! Was this chance or will all 2,048 possibilities reveal the same thing?

<div class="journal">

  **Sunday.** Yesterday we watched _The Boy and the Heron_ at Angelika. It would have been overwhelming(ly confusing) had Abi not introduced me to _Paprika_ and _Howl's Moving Castle_ earlier this year. Maybe my interpretation is obvious and banal, but it moved me to think about the fantastic worlds our unconscious will construct and journey, to protect us from our deepest hurts.

</div>

Before we explore other multivalued functions, I worry that my methodology behind concluding that the absolute value function cannot work, is flawed. One thing I can do to increase my confidence is to apply the same methodology to the square root function, which we know must work.

_Oh, right. This is my fantastic world._

So I wrote another program using the square root function. At first, I was disheartened to find it also outputted 0 possibilities—the methodology must be flawed, I thought. But actually, the problem was that I was simply squaring the dot products of perpendicular situations, _e.g._ $\braket{o|u}^2$, whereas I needed to be multiplying by the complex conjugate, _e.g._ $\braket{o|u}\braket{u|o}$.

<a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231126-mathematica">_This_</a> opened up the number of possibilities to **2,048**!

It's actually fortunate that I made the simple squaring mistake. If I had gotten 2,048 possibilities on the first try, I would have questioned my methodology for a second reason. Recovering from 0 to 2,048 essentially showed me that the magic was in the complex conjugate.

<!-- Next, I think I need to stand back and review all that's happened so far. I need to evaluate whether I should explore a third multivalued function, or accept that a third or even fourth multivalued function will not elucidate for me, the reason squaring-with-complex-conjugates is the multivalued function that works. Perhaps the secret requires a certain amount of knowledge in **group theory** or the broader **abstract algebra**, which I don't have. -->

  **Saturday.** Kimmy, Tina, and Joan are here. Squid Game is now a reality show? They brought a sour from Grimm—a _Gathering Cabernet Franc_ 👌.

</div>

Yesterday we further narrowed our possible choices to 128. Let's pick one from this set and try again:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{r}=&&\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{l}=&&\frac{i}{2}&\ket{u}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{o}=&&\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}-\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{i}=&&\frac{i}{2}&\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}
\end{alignat}$$

In column vector form:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\ket{r}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em}
&\ket{l}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ -\frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\ket{o}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em}
&\ket{i}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

We want to solve for $\sigma_x$:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ -\frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
-&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{i}{2} \\\\ -\frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

Wait, something's wrong with this one too.

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&+\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=&\frac{1}{2} \\\\
\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=&-\frac{i}{2}
\end{alignat}$$

Multiply the second equation by $i$ to get:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&+\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=\frac{1}{2} \\\\
-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&-\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&&=\frac{1}{2}
\end{alignat}$$

Then add the two equations:

$$0 = 1$$

$$\bot$$

No solution, once again. And I know why, and I'm an idiot. It wasn't just _duplicates_ and _negatives_ that were unsolvable. **_Any scalar multiples of one another_, including duplicates and negatives, were never going to work.** _That_ is the _real_ fourth criterion. A [Stack Overflow post](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/132348/6944) offers a way to detect that 2 vectors are scalar multiples of—or more concisely, _parallel_ to—one another. Updating the <a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231125-mathematica-2">code</a> to filter these out rather than just duplicates and negatives, the result?

**0 possibilities. There is no way to satisfy the four criteria using the absolute value function for our multivalued function.**

<h2>November 23 & 24, 2023</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Thursday.** Little Neck for Thanksgiving at my cousins'. We matched colors, pretended to be tourists at Grand Central, made the LIRR ticket inspector shuffle through 50 punched tickets because Abi wanted hers back as a souvenir, and stopped to look at trees. // **Friday.** I'm remembering, we'd also passed through Douglaston, where we could see the Tudor-style house I lived in in 1996, visible from the train. Back then—I was 8—I never knew, never wondered where this train came from or went. It was just a recurring sound that drowned out our voices while we played dodgeball in the parking lot. In that cul-de-sac also was a small, first-floor office outfitted as a "computer school" where I went to learn how to type. And it was living in that house that one day we found something strange in our mail—a red CD with a picture of a hat on it. We didn't have a computer and no one knew what the CD was for, but I was allowed to keep it, like a shiny rock. In 1998—I was 10—we finally got a personal computer and I put the CD in, but was disappointed when nothing happened. It was many years later—by then the CD was lost, both physically and from my memory—that I heard or read the words, _"Red Hat Linux"_. It's just crazy to think—someone in 1996 was going door to door dropping free CDs (which weren't cheap) in the mail, all in the name of open source software.

</div>

Anyway, last time we left off at discovering 288 possibilities of coefficients that pass [the three criteria](#20231116-criteria). Let's look at one of them:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{r}=&&\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{l}=&&-\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}-\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{o}=&&\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}-\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{i}=&&-\frac{1}{2}&\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}
\end{alignat}$$

I'm looking for a reason to invalidate that choice of coefficients, because I didn't expect the absolute value function to yield even 1 working possibility, let alone 288. Let's skip ahead to deriving **spin operators**. We rewrite the situations in column vector form:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\ket{r}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em}
&\ket{l}&=\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\ket{o}&=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \hspace{2em}
&\ket{i}&=\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

Let's start with $\ket{r}$ and $\ket{l}$. We want to solve for $\sigma_x$:

$$\begin{alignat}{3}
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
&\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\begin{bmatrix}
(\sigma_x)\_{11} & (\sigma_x)\_{12} \\\\
(\sigma_x)\_{21} & (\sigma_x)\_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&&\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix} &=
-&\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\frac{i}{2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{alignat}$$

Take just the top rows:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&+\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&=\frac{1}{2} \\\\
-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{11}&-\frac{i}{2}(\sigma_x)\_{12}&=\frac{1}{2}
\end{alignat}$$

Summing these equations lead to:

$$0 = 1$$

$$\bot$$

It turns out we need a fourth criterion: $\ket{r}\ne-\ket{l}$ and $\ket{o}\ne-\ket{i}$, or else you end up with a degenerate<sup>1</sup> system that can't be solved. Adding this to the <a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231125-mathematica">code</a>, we are down to **128** possibilities.

Anyway, on Friday we wanted to know: What are _all_ the alternate choices of coefficients for $\ket{l}$ that could lead to satisfying [the three criteria](#20231116-criteria)? I thought it'd be easier to just write a <a class="modal-opener" data-modal-id="modal-20231124-mathematica">program</a> that tries out all possibilities of coefficients for $\ket{r}$, $\ket{l}$, $\ket{o}$, and $\ket{i}$. Here's what it reveals:

1. Again, although there are infinite values in $\mathbb{C}$ whose absolute values are $\frac{1}{2}$ (the first criterion), for simplicity's sake, let's see if solutions exist that only use the values on the axes: \$\frac{1}{2}$, $-\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{i}{2}$, and $-\frac{i}{2}$. Combinatorically, this is choosing from 4 elements, 8 times (2 coefficients per situation), or 4<sup>8</sup>, which is **65,536** possibilities.

1. Of those, **4,096** pass the second criteria that $\braket{r|l}$ and $\braket{o|i}$ compute to zero.

1. Of those, **512** pass the third criteria that all "perpendicular" cases such as $\braket{r|o}$ and $\braket{r|i}$, including the cases involving $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$, compute to an absolute value of $\frac{1}{2}$.

1. Among those, I looked at some examples and noticed duplicates, _e.g._ $\ket{r}=\ket{l}=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}$. These pass the first criterion because of imaginary numbers multiplying to negatives. But they're clearly invalid since then those situations would be indistinguishable. Filtering them out, we're left with **288** possibilities.

I was quite surprised by this number. I was hoping for **0**—that way I could say, _"And this is why the absolute value function cannot be the multivalued function that fits."_ But instead, now we'll have to go further to see where using the absolute value function breaks down experimentally, if it does at all.

<div class="journal">

  **Friday.** At Amy's to help with a mouse problem; she's still somewhere in Europe.

</div>

The answer to yesterday's question is _no_—our particular formulation does _not_ meet "the third criteria," _i.e._ that $\braket{r|o}$ and $\braket{l|o}$ and $\braket{r|i}$ and $\braket{l|i}$ all yield 50% probabilities.

$$\begin{alignat}{5}
\braket{r|o}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{d|d}&&=\frac{i}{2}&\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\braket{l|o}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+(-\frac{1}{2})\frac{i}{2}\braket{d|d}&&=0&\not\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\braket{r|i}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+\frac{1}{2}(-\frac{i}{2})\braket{d|d}&&=\frac{i}{2}&\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\braket{l|i}&=\frac{1}{2}\frac{i}{2}\braket{u|u}+(-\frac{1}{2})(-\frac{i}{2})\braket{d|d}&&=0&\not\rightarrow 50\\%\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

What went wrong? It's simple. Algebraically,

$$\begin{alignedat}{3}
(\alpha\bra{u}+\alpha\bra{d})(\beta\ket{u}-\beta\ket{d})&=\alpha\beta\braket{u|u}&&-\alpha\beta\braket{u|d}\\\\
& &&+\alpha\beta\braket{d|u}-\alpha\beta\braket{d|d}\\\\
&=0
\end{alignedat}$$

Getting a zero this way was the desired effect for $\braket{r|l}$ and $\braket{o|i}$, but not for these perpendicular pairings. It's almost like programming now. What can we change so that for $\braket{l|o}$ and $\braket{l|i}$ the sign becomes positive but not for $\braket{l|u}$ and $\braket{l|d}$?

The choices are fewer than you'd think. In the classical style of proofs, let's make an assertion: Either $\ket{l}$ needs to change, or $\ket{o}$ and $\ket{i}$ need to change, or both. Right? They span the _entirety_ of options in our context.

Let's talk about $\ket{l}$ changing. Let's go all the way back to:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{r}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{l}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

What all could we even change $\ket{l}$ _to_? If we remain in the domain of complex numbers, the entirety of values that pass the "first criteria," _i.e._ their absolute values being $\frac{1}{2}$, _on_ the axes, are $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{i}{2}$, $-\frac{1}{2}$, and $-\frac{i}{2}$. (_Off_ the axes, all of the values on the continuous circle $\frac{1}{2}e^{i\theta}$ would pass. More on that later.)

  **Wednesday.** Rehearsal felt strangely nice—in brief moments we spoke like friends. I expressed appreciation to Mark for backing me up on the root notes of the verse of _Can't You See_. He smiled. // **Thursday.** No notes.

</div>

Let's continue where we left—seeing if we can find a suitable formula for $\ket{o}$ and $\ket{i}$ in terms of $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$, in the "absolute value world."

We can safely say we can't choose the same formulas that we did for $\ket{r}$ and $\ket{l}$. Neither $\ket{o}$ nor $\ket{i}$ should equal $\ket{r}$ or $\ket{l}$. And the following is not valid either:

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{o}&=-\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{i}&=-\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

These are the same as $\ket{r}$ and $\ket{l}$, only looking at the world upside-down. What else can we possibly do to get coefficients with absolute values of $\frac{1}{2}$? Well, we can introduce complex numbers, _i.e._

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{o}&=\frac{i}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{i}&=\frac{i}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{i}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

<a name="20231116-criteria"></a>

This meets the first criteria: The absolute values of all these coefficients are $\frac{1}{2}$. It also meets the second criteria: $\braket{o|i}$ indeed computes to zero. Does it meet the third criteria, _i.e._ do $\braket{r|o}$ and $\braket{l|o}$ and $\braket{r|i}$ and $\braket{l|i}$ all yield 50% probabilities?

<h2>November 13, 2023</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Monday.** It's dawn at the start of a new week. Pausing to watch a red sunrise.

</div>

Let's continue where we left off yesterday—seeing what happens if we use the absolute value function for our multivalued function. We want to solve for $\ket{l}$:

$$\left(\bra{u}\frac{1}{2}+\bra{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)\ket{l}=0$$

Does this replacement work?

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\left(\bra{u}\frac{1}{2}+\bra{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\ket{u}\frac{1}{2}-\ket{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)&=\frac{1}{4}\braket{u|u}-\frac{1}{4}\braket{d|d}\\\\
&=\frac{1}{4}(1)-\frac{1}{4}(1)\\\\
&=0
\end{alignat}$$

It does! And so does the choice of

$$\left(-\ket{u}\frac{1}{2}+\ket{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)$$

I _think_ that that ambiguity maps to the ambiguity of up versus down. Whereas perhaps the square root's additional ambiguity maps to the ambiguity of $x$ vs. $z$ axes of orientation. We'll have a better guess shortly.

Now that we have the following...

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{r}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\ket{l}&=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}\\\\
\end{alignat}$$

...let's figure out $\ket{o}$ and $\ket{i}$. The probability of reading $+1$ versus $-1$ in the $\ket{u}$ orientation after setting up $\ket{o}$ is once again 50%-50%.

$$\begin{align}
\left|\braket{u|o}\right|=\frac{1}{2}\\\\
\left|\braket{d|o}\right|=\frac{1}{2}
\end{align}$$

<h2>November 12, 2023</h2>

<div class="journal">

  **Sunday.** Just got back from grocery shopping with Abi. It's suddenly winter-y cold today, making it feel strangely cozy inside. She's making us enchiladas verdes while I write.

</div>

I wondered what the relationship was between the concept of **probability amplitudes** being defined as _square roots_ of probabilities and the fact that square roots are a multivalued function, therefore conveniently introducing a "degree of freedom" to whatever relation they're describing. **Can a different multivalued function be used to represent spin states? If not, what do square roots enable that other multivalued functions don't?**

For example, the _absolute value_ function. Mimicking Lecture 2, suppose we assert

$$\ket{A}=\alpha_u\ket{u}+\alpha_d\ket{d}$$

But instead of saying that $\alpha_u^*\alpha_u$ and $\alpha_d^*\alpha_d$ are the probabilities of measuring $\ket{u}$ and $\ket{d}$, suppose it's $|\alpha_u|$ and $|\alpha_d|$. Then we can say one potential solution for $\ket{r}$ is

$$\ket{r}=\frac{1}{2}\ket{u}+\frac{1}{2}\ket{d}$$

Next, to "fix" $\ket{l}$, we have no choice but to import the concept of bra-vectors. (I see—this is something I had left out until now.) We "know" that

$$\braket{r|l}=0$$

and so

$$\left(\bra{u}\frac{1}{2}+\bra{d}\frac{1}{2}\right)\ket{l}=0$$

Pause. What concepts did we begin with, and what concepts have we imported?

- We began with our own concept of "situations" notated $\ket{X}$ that act like **quantities**, _i.e._ can be added and multiplied to and with.
- We even began with the notation $\braket{Y|X}$ representing sort of a compound situation, pre-measurement.
- We did _not_ begin with the existence of the notation $\bra{Y}$. We've imported this along with the fact that, in this alternate system using the absolute value function, $\bra{Y}\equiv\ket{Y}$.
- And since the notation $\bra{Y}$ didn't even exist, we did _not_ begin with the fact that $\braket{Y|X}$ is simply a multiplication, $\bra{Y}\times\ket{X}$.

Okay! I think I have a better formulation of the original goal that will give rise to the algebra we're trying to assert:

<div class="declaration">
  <p>Given the symbols $\ket{u}$, $\ket{d}$, $\ket{r}$, $\ket{l}$, $\ket{o}$, $\ket{i}$ to represent <em>situations</em> (an orientation <em>and</em> measurement in a particular direction), and the symbols $\bra{u}$, $\bra{d}$, $\bra{r}$, $\bra{l}$, $\bra{o}$, $\bra{i}$ to mean a re-orientation in a particular direction (<em>without</em> measurement), can we invent an algebra in which these symbols can be treated as quantities (being addable, multipliable, etc.), and in which the multiplication of $\bra{y}\times\ket{x}$ not only represents the <em>situationship</em> $\braket{y|x}$ but conveniently <em>computes</em> to the probability of the situationship in that particular direction?</p>
</div>

Perfect—very happy with this.
