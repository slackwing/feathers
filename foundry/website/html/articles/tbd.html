Cue an overplayed analogy about knowledge vs. understanding—but I promise today there's more substance behind the analogues: _If knowledge is a map, understanding is knowing where you are and where you're going._

Certainly, one way to "understand" is to find and place every puzzle piece.

empathy, foundations
hey, i know you wanna go that way, but there's a cliff over there

If knowledge is a map, understanding is knowing where you're going.

Some housekeeping before we begin. I assume the student has read Lecture 1. 

Of course, that depends on the student—on how discerning they are about what **understanding** is.
But this article doesn't attempt
Well, that depends on the student. A student who expresses a more discerning attitude toward learning is, in a way, a student with greater needs—a student with greater expectations of the teacher and the learning materials presented to them. Made aware of this gap, both student and teacher rush to find more knowledge to fill it. But in doing so, they overlook another dimension: _What drives those needs or expectations in the first place?_ This article is a re-telling of the lecture that focuses on _that_. I hope to show the student 
I have an opinion on that, but 
This article is a re-telling of the lecture that focuses on _that_, whatever it may be.
the student's dissatisfaction
I believe in doing so, it will transfer more understanding, with less knowledge. But I'll let the student judge the efficacy of this method.



I would argue that what the student _really_ desires is **understanding**.
I would argue yes, but not by that kind of knowledge. I would argue that what the student really desires is _understanding_
an empathetic re-telling
I would say yes, but not with the kind of knowledge usually sought.
In this article I will re-teach Lecture 2 with _less_ knowledge, but more _empathy_.
If one were to observe ... psychologically ... it would become obvious that knowledge only defers the need
But to sate these needs, both student and teacher typically only think to reach for more knowledge, overlooking the _emotional_ dimension of science.
science is much more of an emotional process than scientists are {willing} to admit
Let us now see the power of empathy in

IMO might undermine more than build the student's confidence. It presents its points as self-evident
