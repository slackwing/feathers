As early as I began a system where I always read fiction and non-fiction at the same time, I've noticed an improbable synergy between the two, and often an intense one—not shallow. The earliest I remember is reading _The Brothers Karamazov_ and _Godel, Escher, Bach_ at the same time. I began waver unconsciously into the narrator's mind, then the mind of someone they're talking about, then the mind of the narrator if they were manifested the way that someone knew, and I felt ...

10 years later, I ran into another profound pair. It's _The Creative Act_ by Rick Rubin and _Men Explain Things to Me_ by Rebecca Solnit.

There is a chapter in _Men Explain Things to Me_ named Woolf's Darkness. It caught me off-guard. Woolf's To the Lighthouse marked a significant event in my life. It was as if I gained the right to exist—the right to think what I think—not suppressed by patriarchy, the meaning of which I didn't even know until I read this book and another (The Will to Change by Bell Hooks).
