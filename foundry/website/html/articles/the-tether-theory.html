### An outline that makes sense specifically to me.

  1. Consider time a 4th spatial dimension $t$, however popularly misunderstood or naive. I'd like breach this topic using popular metaphors and illustrations then shed the superficial pieces later, after forming useful intuitions.
  1. Imagine there being a 5th spatial dimension $u$ as well.
  1. In order to be able to use 3-dimensional visualizations to discuss a 4th and 5th dimensions, let's "make room" by replacing our most familiar dimensions $x$, $y$, $z$ with a 1-dimensional proxy, $s$. This means displacement in $s$—albeit restricted to a line—reflects displacement in $(x, y, z)$. [Image]
  1. It's easy then to imagine that a path in $(s, t)$ reflects movement in time $(x, y, z, t)$. [Image]
  1. Now let depth represent yet another dimension, $u$. And consider a set of $(s, t)$ paths that are parallel to one another. One may import the popularized notion of "parallel timelines" here, if only to anchor on a familiar concept before we continue into the abstract. [Image]
      - The way nature (on our scale) appears always to be continuous. [Ocean waves, etc.] Take an ideal form such as a square. Zoom in on a corner. In nature, it eventually appears to be a rounded corner. Sharp discontinuities are our own invention.
  1. What is between these paths? We imagine $(s, t, u)$ being continuous. [Image]
  1. This opens up the possibility of paths traveling _across_ $u$—or "between timelines". Let's bring into focus _what_ is traveling so it's easier to imagine—let's say it's a particle.

### Main outline and ideas.

  1. **Present the unsettling mystery of the double-slit experiment.** (Check with Vedant and maybe Physics SO or Meta or Chat later.) To the atheistic scientistic type, it offends the senses to suggest that humans are somehow "special." (Show an animal—no collapse.) [State this as a fact. Maybe disclaim in endnotes. I mean, if it turns out to be false, then it doesn't matter, all this was fiction.]
  1. [Leave until nearly finished.] **A summary of the proposal.** The collapsing of alternate paths into one decided future; reverse-propagating to the present like tethers.
  1. 

### Musings.

  1. Where does "possibility" even come from? One idea: Imagine 2 particles colliding at _exactly_ 90 degrees. I think there's ambiguity here, as to which particle would go "left" or "right" versus the other. Could that ambiguity be at the heart of possibilities? In fact, maybe the particles don't _have_ to leave at 90 degrees—maybe all directions in 3-space is possible. Either one particle's trajectory determines the other, or the second particle still has a degree of freedom. Let me run with the former. Then the potential trajectories out can be captured by $\theta$ and $\phi$.
  1. A planet has a future that is quite difficult to change. And so its tethers drag with it everything in its vicinity, like us. And that "dragging" is what we experience as gravity. From a higher dimension, the dragging (in the static frame) is simply: Continuity.

### Format and organization ideas.

  1. Maybe write in the introduction that I'm writing this for Abi. I only need to be understood by one person.
  1. Might have to find a novel way to really quickly prop up the spacetime analogy, _e.g._ look at illusions such as this and this [3D looking art that turns out to be 2D when the camera is moved, Rene Magritte, the concave sculpture of a head whose gaze follows you, ...]

### Ideas to wave in later.

  1. The influence of belief (_e.g._ prayer) in "constraining the lattice," first thought of after reading [this Psychology Today article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotional-behavior-behavioral-emotions/202401/how-time-perception-influences-physical-healing).
  1. So strange, like we've been groping in the dark and feeling the truth but unable to see. Interstellar's _love_ as a force—love is truly a strong, long-term tether for humans, no? And remember the year when the concept of dropping into an alternate timeline got really popular? (What might cause this? It's almost like... _un_-tethering...)
  1. Could perhaps an alternate test of AGI be, having the (supposed) AGI observe the double-slit experiment?
