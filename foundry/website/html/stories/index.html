    <h1 id="the-violin">The Violin</h1>

    <p>
      In the breath before the bow met string, she—and I—had to achieve zen-like
      emptiness, and simultaneously, a spotless memory. Flawless wasn't
      enough—it had to appear effortless. "I'm a fraud," my player thought
      despite success, "Not half as good as they believe. One polished act is
      all they see." Yes, I can hear the thoughts of my player, and others
      nearby, but only if they resonate with my own. You see I'm also not half
      as good as my player believes—I myself am a fraud.
    </p>

    <p>
      I came to as I was tuned in 1963, in Erlangen, Germany. The late war never
      reached the town's wide but quiet streets, its thoughtful open squares,
      all built by French refugees. Front cut of Alpine spruce and flamed maple
      back, I was an imitation of a renowned predecessor crafted in 1914. I
      passed through several masters and emigrated across the Atlantic, where
      for the first time I was placed in the hands of a young student. But one
      month prior the dealer had replaced the label inside of me. I sold for
      more than double my worth, now reading "Ernst Heinrich Roth, Bubenreuth /
      Erlangen, anno 1914."
    </p>

    <p>
      Later I came to learn the exploited parents were already in poor financial
      standing—convinced by teachers that a lesser instrument would stunt their
      young prodigy. The girl vowed, "I won't disappoint them," I the same to
      her, and since then we worked tirelessly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The auditorium at Julliard was frigid but you could smell the heat of the
      spotlights. A row of judges sat mute. Our opening breath wasn't out of
      sync, but trembled. We held together through the swells and lulls of
      Mendelssohn's Concerto in E. But approaching the cadenza I overthought a
      measure we'd only played by muscle memory. The zen—a precarious lucid
      dream—unraveled; I grasped a C# too tight; the girl stumbled. The dream
      was over. When numbness subsided, I was on the girl's bed. I thought,
      "It's all my fault." "It's all my fault," she echoed unexpectedly. "They
      fight because we have no money. They have no money because of me." I was
      startled. Did my thoughts resonate into... Fear spread through my grain.
      All this time, was it my own... Thankfully the girl played no more, though
      she brought me along to university. I willingly hid underneath her bunk,
      out of sight and relieved to influence her no longer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Years later the girl began life in the city and was badly in need of
      money. I was taken to a shop on 57th street and left to be appraised.
      Finally, I thought, the truth would come out and the girl could be rid of
      me. A few days later the girl returned, and the appraiser shared the
      expected news that I wasn't actually the famed 1914. E. H. Roth didn't
      move to Erlangen until 1953. Having prepared for this moment, I took one
      last look at the little girl whose face never aged for me. But she said,
      "I think I'd like to keep it then, after all." A yearning rose up in
      me—I'd desperately wanted to be kept. She packed me up with usual care and
      we rode the subway home, lighter, quietly reflecting.
    </p>

    <p>
      The days as usual grew long then short but in a different key. Beneath her
      bed the cats hide and sleep, whispering and keeping me company. Every now
      and then she takes me out to play a nostalgic tune, untroubled by
      mistakes. Each time we move apartments she carries me last, sitting me
      beside her in the front seat.

          No news in general—seemed the whole port savored a lazy Friday
          afternoon. I took some gin too, with my dinner at Café des Palmes. A
          table of junior officers in good spirits, raising their glasses every
          few minutes. One raised his toward me—I only nodded back, but he was
          deeply pleased. Drunk, the world is always right, until it turns

    <h1 id="snow-delivery">Snow Delivery</h1>

    <p>
      It was 4:45am when I heard a distant <em>thup</em> and half stood up on
      the sofa to peek out the grass-level window of Rault's basement. The TV
      carried on at low volume. The street brightened until the headlights came
      into view, then the windshield, then a hand coming out the opposite window
      to fling what anyone else would have assumed to be today's papers,
      expertly onto the center of each snow-coated driveway. <em>Thup.</em> Next
      the car pulled up to Rault's, but stopped instead of rolling slowly past.
      Rault, across the sofa, sat as if unstirred, staring through the TV with a
      knuckle to his lip. Our contrasting pose was a feature of our friendship:
      I was Rault's anxious limb who responded as he'd have liked to, so that he
      could stay cool. Finally—<em>thup</em>. Then the car drove on, the
      engine's rev breaking Rault's fixed gaze, now softer and pointed toward
      the TV stand. I sat back down to commence the ritual wait of not appearing
      too eager.
    </p>

    <p>
      I knew what Rault had hoped to hear: the engine going quiet, the soft open
      and shut of a car door, the crunching of footsteps across a frozen lawn,
      then finally a doorbell that would ring away all the oppressive air that
      had accumulated through the night. He believed that when Jaime walked in,
      anything wrong could be righted. We all did. But Jaime drove away, and I
      could feel Rault contending with the reality that had just been delivered:
      he'd have to go on feeling this way—the way we'd spent all night evading.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'll grab it," I said after waiting long enough. Sobering from the bite
      of the cold, I crossed the lawn, wondering if my footsteps in lieu of
      Jaime's might somehow soothe Rault.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rault called me earlier asking if I had some on me. I knew he had to be
      feeling down from last weekend, when a heated moment drew out some words
      that landed sideways on Jaime; our easygoing, amiable friend went quiet in
      a way no one had seen before. So I went over to help Rault hash out events
      from a more generous point of view—induced by the gram or so I'd brought
      with me. When we ran out three hours ago, we knew what we were in for. The
      newfound feelings of forgiveness we had for everyone—for others, for
      ourselves—would fade. We expected to smooth out the comedown as usual by
      drinking for a few hours more. But not long after, Rault asked me to text
      Jaime, who was not only our friend but also the local paperboy and the
      local dealer, for a re-up. My head swirled at the thought of another high
      this late into the night, but understanding Rault, I obliged.
    </p>

    <p>
      Picking up the bundled papers from the driveway, I walked back tracing my
      footsteps. I slipped off my shoes in the foyer and started down the stairs,
      unraveling the papers as I went. That's when I found, among the items we
      ordered, a folded piece of yellow memo paper. I tossed some dimebags onto
      the table and opened the note as I walked toward the sofa. Then I had to
      suppress my smile so as to leave it all for Rault. The note read
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; page-break-inside: avoid;">
      ON ME<br />
      DONT WORRY ABOUT IT BRO
    </p>

    <p>
      We gazed together at the TV for a while, Rault still holding the note,
      both having forgotten the craving that delivered it.

    <h1 id="the-fight-in-canada">The Fight in Canada</h1>

    <p>
      Maybe we'd sealed our own fate already when I said, "It's a short
      trip—think we can make this one without a fight?" and she—tired of the
      hanging gloom since that morning's argument—said, "Yeah, we just need to
      hold back a little. Both of us," and I—eager myself to change out the
      leaden air—dove in haphazardly, too quickly to sound grave, "I'll do my
      best, I promise. We can do it." But for the rest of that evening we asked
      each other superfluous questions about whether the other had remembered to
      pack this or that, just happy to hear our voices fill the apartment again.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hand on the steering wheel begged for something to do on the
      straightaway we hadn't said a word on since leaving the city. The other
      hand mindlessly grazed the stubble on my chin, watching mile marker 183
      zip by. Pulling away an elbow from its uncomfortable jam against the
      window, I asked, "Do you want some music?" 185—zip. 186—zip. I imagined
      her brooding on how we didn't make it 15 minutes without a fight. A
      misunderstanding about where the rental car was supposed to be picked up.
      My frustration wasn't with her, but to her it was, and her frustration
      with me was with me, which made me frustrated with her with her, proving
      her point. I reflected: It didn't even occur to me to "do my best"—it all
      happened in an instant. 190—zip—halfway to Canada. Just then the highway
      entered a newly lain section of asphalt, abruptly muting the white noise
      we'd taken for granted. The new silence was certainly more dramatic than
      she intended—so now we were both feeling awkward. "Maybe something soft,"
      she finally said, unlocking her phone, "Maybe Plans?" She had to give up
      her indifferent posture to pair the bluetooth. As she leaned toward the
      dashboard I felt the electricity of her new proximity, the closest she'd
      been to me all day.
    </p>

    <p>
      A car behind changed lanes, telegraphing impatience. I looked at my
      speedometer—below the limit. I pressed on the gas, practically flooring
      it, but we were only slowing. Then: sputtering, jerking. She was alert and
      looking at me—now the dashboard—now the gauges. My gut sank when I saw.
      I'd been so preoccupied, I'd forgotten to stop for gas. Do your best.
      "Shit. I wasn't paying attention. Sorry." We'd had arguments before about
      filling the tank well before it went empty. Merging onto the shoulder, I
      imagined the gravity of her blame slowing the car to zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      We listened patiently to the man with aviators and long white hair
      whipping in the wind, standing too close to the road as cars streaked by,
      making us both uneasy, though at least—I'm sure we were both thinking—he
      was waving around the bright yellow cannister he'd refueled us with as he
      talked; hopefully cars would see. His easygoing but authoritative
      voice—pointing us to the nearest gas station that wasn't ripping us
      off—dissolved periodically into the harsh noise of another car speeding
      by—like searing on a pan—but we smiled and nodded as if we heard with
      perfect alacritty. I'm sure we looked exactly the same in that moment.
      When he finally felt assured we wouldn't lose our way, we spent the last
      of our reserves thanking him with extra cheer, rolled up our windows, sank
      back slowly into our seats, and took a deep breath. Probably both
      disconcerted and unable to remember what to resume feeling about each
      other. But defeated by the wait and epic directions to somewhere we
      weren't going, we gave up on reaching Montreal that night. She booked an
      inn at the nearest exit and we checked in, hungry and feeling
      unaccomplished.
    </p>

    <p>
      We found that restaurants up here closed early. The nearest grocery store
      was another exit over—an upstate exit. And the car felt equally as far,
      sitting on a second-story hotel bed. The room was sterile—in decor, in
      sound—except for a portrait on the wall of a clear, cold-looking lake
      reflecting a cloudless sky and mountains around it lush in Autumn reds and
      oranges. We had originally planned to set out early tomorrow morning for a
      hike and lakeside picnic in the outskirts of Montreal. "We have to get our
      cooler and put the meats in the fridge," I said, remembering. A trip back
      to the car after all. She said, "Do you think we can cook here?" We had
      brought a portable burner. I looked around the room and spotted a modern
      fire sprinkler. "I don't know if we should risk it." She was searching for
      an outlet near the window. "Hey, there's a roof outside our window." I
      walked over to see. She unlatched the window and it swung wide open unlike
      windows in the city, and roused a shared instinct in us to climb through
      the open portal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The summer day was beginning to cool but a warm breeze took us by the arms
      and received us amiably as we stepped out of the relatively frigid air
      conditioned room. The rural quiet was dotted by the arythmic chirping of a
      few song sparrows. Beyond the edge of the roof, a darkening green and
      evening-blue field of a grass stretched half a mile out, then rose up into
      a shadowy wall of maple and pine whose tops were catching the light of a
      sunset we couldn't see, coming from the other side of the hotel. "I don't
      think anyone can see us if we stay near the window," she said, "Eat out
      here?" I nodded, still looking at the striking light on tops of trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      As she started the burner outside, I poured some wine we'd brought for the
      picnic into tiny paper cups and reached out the window to set one down
      near her. She stopped her task to take a sip, motioning a subtle cheers
      before she drank. One at a time I placed our dinner materials outside—the
      marinated meats, a container of sliced vegetables, cutlery, my wine—and
      then climbed out with some napkins in hand. I was becoming a little
      self-conscious of the mess we were making on the roof, but she seemed
      unconcerned, which, I noted, mattered more. Soon everything was cooking.
      We wiped our hands and looked back out into the field, the sizzling of the
      grill doing a heroic job of emulating the buzz of lively conversation. I
      wondered why I wasn't feeling more guilty, having gotten us stranded. I
      wondered how she was doing, still sitting in silence while I was feeling
      strangely light. Wary of the disconnect between us, I decided to stay
      quiet and let her say something when she was ready.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the language of eating isn't so easy to restrain. We didn't know
      another way to eat off the grill than to pick out the best pieces to put
      on each other's plate. Each repetition alluding to a desire we couldn't
      say. Ravaged by then, we were inwardly grateful. And slowly our motions
      began to recover their spring, as if in between each bite we'd been
      throwing off layers of heavy clothing. We both seemed to wait for a chance
      to pour the other more wine. The sun having set, our eyes adjusted to the
      evening shade, rendering all parts of the field more fairly so it now felt
      like we were inside it. We began to recline more comfortably, leaving
      leftovers to cool on the grill—its buzzing now continued by an evening
      chorus of insects. "That was good," she said unexpectedly. I replied
      simply, "That was very good." We sat a while, each letting out a sigh as
      we gazed out into the field, the wine and air mingling at the surface of
      our skin in perfect balance.
    </p>

    <p>
      A time came amidst the afterglow when a touch of sadness meandering
      through the air passed through both of us. The beginning of the feeling
      when you don't want something to end, so you hurry to redraw your
      attention to taking in what you can. But it wasn't hard to let the sound
      of crickets pull us back in, singing surely against the fading backdrop.
      So we let out another sigh and continued floating, this time better
      prepared for an ending.
    </p>

    <p>
      The breeze picked up, and something made me feel that I should take the
      initiative. I started,
    </p>

    <p>"I'm sorry about this morning."</p>

    <p>"No..." she shook her head.</p>

    <p>"I shouldn't have gotten so frustrated."</p>

    <p>"I shouldn't have taken it personally."</p>

    <p>"It's easy to when someone's being like me."</p>

    <p>
      "No, it's not just you. It's how anger always sounds to me—like it's at
      me. I was always like this, even before I met you."
    </p>

    <p>"I think that's normal."</p>

    <p>"It wasn't normal for you, growing up."</p>

    <p>
      I acknowledged her with silence, wanting to give her as much as she was
      giving me but finding nothing to match. I rubbed my arms and shifted my
      position—it was starting to get chilly. We seemed to sit stiller than
      before, as if afraid to cause an ending, searching for something that was
      missed.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I wasn't at my best this morning. I don't know what it was. But I can be
      better."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I know. And you are—you've come so far since three years ago." It was
      almost too much.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I want to show you..." Any way that sentence could go felt deficient. She
      waited.
    </p>

    <p>
      "If we could start the day over," she offered, "I can imagine how much
      better we'd do."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yeah," I recovered, "Yeah, I'd like to try that fight again." She let out
      a small laugh then a sniffle—was it the cold or had she been...
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'm sure you'll get to try again soon," she said. I laughed too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Could we really have gone so long in that heaviness? Was lightness always
      within reach? I poured each of us the last of the wine, which gave us a
      definite sense of the ending. We didn't delay nor hurry.
    </p>

    <p>"Ever have a picnic on a hotel roof before?"</p>

    <p>She laughed. "Why was it so good?"</p>

    <p>
      "Should we just head home? The trip might have peaked already." We
      laughed.
    </p>

    <p>[Describe more scene.]</p>

    <p>"I know you were joking, but we should still go."</p>

    <p>[Describe more scene, final bits of conversation.]</p>

    <p>"To Canada then, where we'll fight a little better."</p>

    <p>"To Canada."</p>
