  <h1 id="the-violin">The Violin</h1>

  <p>
    In the breath before the bow met string, she—and I—had to achieve zen-like
    emptiness, and simultaneously, a spotless memory. Flawless wasn't
    enough—it had to appear effortless. "I'm a fraud," my player thought
    despite success, "Not half as good as they believe. One polished act is
    all they see." Yes, I can hear the thoughts of my player, and others
    nearby, but only if they resonate with my own. You see I'm also not half
    as good as my player believes—I myself am a fraud.
  </p>

  <p>
    I came to as I was tuned in 1963, in Erlangen, Germany. The late war never
    reached the town's wide but quiet streets, its thoughtful open squares,
    all built by French refugees. Front cut of Alpine spruce and flamed maple
    back, I was an imitation of a renowned predecessor crafted in 1914. I
    passed through several masters and emigrated across the Atlantic, where
    for the first time I was placed in the hands of a young student. But one
    month prior the dealer had replaced the label inside of me. I sold for
    more than double my worth, now reading "Ernst Heinrich Roth, Bubenreuth /
    Erlangen, anno 1914."
  </p>

  <p>
    Later I came to learn the exploited parents were already in poor financial
    standing—convinced by teachers that a lesser instrument would stunt their
    young prodigy. The girl vowed, "I won't disappoint them," I the same to
    her, and since then we worked tirelessly.
  </p>

  <p>
    The auditorium at Julliard was frigid but you could smell the heat of the
    spotlights. A row of judges sat mute. Our opening breath wasn't out of
    sync, but trembled. We held together through the swells and lulls of
    Mendelssohn's Concerto in E. But approaching the cadenza I overthought a
    measure we'd only played by muscle memory. The zen—a precarious lucid
    dream—unraveled; I grasped a C# too tight; the girl stumbled. The dream
    was over. When numbness subsided, I was on the girl's bed. I thought,
    "It's all my fault." "It's all my fault," she echoed unexpectedly. "They
    fight because we have no money. They have no money because of me." I was
    startled. Did my thoughts resonate into... Fear spread through my grain.
    All this time, was it my own... Thankfully the girl played no more, though
    she brought me along to university. I willingly hid underneath her bunk,
    out of sight and relieved to influence her no longer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Years later the girl began life in the city and was badly in need of
    money. I was taken to a shop on 57th street and left to be appraised.
    Finally, I thought, the truth would come out and the girl could be rid of
    me. A few days later the girl returned, and the appraiser shared the
    expected news that I wasn't actually the famed 1914. E. H. Roth didn't
    move to Erlangen until 1953. Having prepared for this moment, I took one
    last look at the little girl whose face never aged for me. But she said,
    "I think I'd like to keep it then, after all." A yearning rose up in
    me—I'd desperately wanted to be kept. She packed me up with usual care and
    we rode the subway home, lighter, quietly reflecting.
  </p>

  <p>
    The days as usual grew long then short but in a different key. Beneath her
    bed the cats hide and sleep, whispering and keeping me company. Every now
    and then she takes me out to play a nostalgic tune, untroubled by
    mistakes. Each time we move apartments she carries me last, sitting me
    beside her in the front seat.

      Signaled passing French convoy. Now awaiting repair tender. I attempted
      in their accent, "De-sti-na-ssiohn?" "Ma-ho-gch." When they clarified,

        No news in general—seemed the whole port savored a lazy Friday
        afternoon. I took some gin too, with my dinner at Café des Palmes. A
        table of junior officers in good spirits, raising their glasses every
        few minutes. One raised his toward me—I only nodded back, but he was
        deeply pleased. Drunk, the world is always right, until it turns

        the extra stop? Logs surely to be sent to insurance considering
        damages. Well... suppose the French found us 2 days later? Very well

  <h1 id="snow-delivery">Snow Delivery</h1>

  <p>
    It was 4:45am when I heard a distant <em>thup</em> and half stood up on
    the sofa to peek out the grass-level window of Rault's basement. The TV
    carried on at low volume. The street brightened until the headlights came
    into view, then the windshield, then a hand coming out the opposite window
    to fling what anyone else would have assumed to be today's papers,
    expertly onto the center of each snow-coated driveway. <em>Thup.</em> Next
    the car pulled up to Rault's, but stopped instead of rolling slowly past.
    Rault, across the sofa, sat as if unstirred, staring through the TV with a
    knuckle to his lip. Our contrasting pose was a feature of our friendship:
    I was Rault's anxious limb who responded as he'd have liked to, so that he
    could stay cool. Finally—<em>thup</em>. Then the car drove on, the
    engine's rev breaking Rault's fixed gaze, now softer and pointed toward
    the TV stand. I sat back down to commence the ritual wait of not appearing
    too eager.
  </p>

  <p>
    I knew what Rault had hoped to hear: the engine going quiet, the soft open
    and shut of a car door, the crunching of footsteps across a frozen lawn,
    then finally a doorbell that would ring away all the oppressive air that
    had accumulated through the night. He believed that when Jaime walked in,
    anything wrong could be righted. We all did. But Jaime drove away, and I
    could feel Rault contending with the reality that had just been delivered:
    he'd have to go on feeling this way—the way we'd spent all night evading.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I'll grab it," I said after waiting long enough. Sobering from the bite
    of the cold, I crossed the lawn, wondering if my footsteps in lieu of
    Jaime's might somehow soothe Rault.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rault called me earlier asking if I had some on me. I knew he had to be
    feeling down from last weekend, when a heated moment drew out some words
    that landed sideways on Jaime; our easygoing, amiable friend went quiet in
    a way no one had seen before. So I went over to help Rault hash out events
    from a more generous point of view—induced by the gram or so I'd brought
    with me. When we ran out two hours ago, we knew what we were in for. The
    newfound feelings of forgiveness we had for everyone—for others, for
    ourselves—would fade. We expected to smooth out the comedown as usual by
    drinking for a few hours more. But not long after, Rault asked me to text
    Jaime, who was not only our friend but also the local paperboy and the
    local dealer, for a re-up. My head swirled at the thought of another high
    this late into the night, but understanding Rault, I obliged.
  </p>

  <p>
    Picking up the bundled papers from the driveway, I walked back tracing my
    footsteps. I slipped off my shoes in the foyer and started down the
    stairs, unraveling the papers as I went. That's when I found, among the
    items we ordered, a folded piece of yellow memo paper. I tossed some
    dimebags onto the table and opened the note as I walked toward the sofa.
    Then I had to suppress my smile so as to leave it all for Rault. The note
    read
  </p>

      ">
    ON ME<br />
    DONT WORRY ABOUT IT BRO
  </p>

  <p>
    We gazed together at the TV for a while, Rault still holding the note,
    both having forgotten the craving that delivered it.
  </p>

  <h1 id="the-fight-in-canada">The Fight in Canada</h1>

  <p>
    Maybe we'd sealed our own fate already when I said, "It's a short
    trip—think we can make this one without a fight?" and she—tired of the
    hanging gloom since that morning's argument—said, "Yeah, we just need to
    hold back a little. Both of us," and I—eager myself to change out the
    leaden air—dove in haphazardly, too quickly to sound grave, "I'll do my
    best, I promise." But for the rest of that evening, we asked each other
    superfluous questions about whether the other had remembered to pack this
    or that, just happy to hear our voices fill the apartment again.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hand on the steering wheel begged for something to do on the
    straightaway we hadn't said a word on since leaving the city. The other
    hand mindlessly grazed the stubble on my chin, watching mile marker 183
    zip by. Pulling away my elbow from its uncomfortable jam against the
    window, I asked, "Do you want some music?" 185—<em>zip</em>.
    186—<em>zip</em>. I imagined her brooding on how we didn't make it 15
    minutes without a fight. A misunderstanding about where the rental car was
    supposed to be picked up. My frustration wasn't with her, but to her it
    was, and her frustration with me <em>was</em> with me, which, predictably,
    redirected mine. I reflected: It didn't even occur to me to "do my
    best"—it all happened in an instant. 190—<em>zip</em>—halfway to Canada.
    Just then the highway entered a newly lain section of asphalt, abruptly
    muting the white noise we'd taken for granted. The new silence was more
    dramatic than she intended—so now we were both feeling awkward. "Maybe
    something soft," she finally said, unlocking her phone, "Maybe
    <em>Plans</em>?" She had to give up her indifferent posture to pair the
    bluetooth. As she leaned toward the dashboard I felt the electricity of
    her new proximity, the closest she'd been to me all day.
  </p>

  <p>
    A car behind changed lanes, telegraphing impatience. I looked at my
    speedometer—below the limit. I pressed on the gas, practically all the
    way, but we were only slowing. Then: sputtering, jerking. She was alert
    and looking at me—now the dashboard—now the gauges. My gut sank when I
    saw. I'd been so preoccupied, I'd forgotten to stop for gas.
    <em>Do your best.</em> "Shit. I wasn't paying attention. Sorry." We'd had
    arguments before about filling the tank well before it went empty. Merging
    onto the shoulder, I imagined the gravity of her blame slowing the car to
    zero.
  </p>

  <p>
    We listened patiently to the man with aviators and long white hair
    whipping in the wind, standing too close to the road as cars streaked by,
    which was making us both uneasy. He was, at least, waving around the
    bright yellow cannister he'd refueled us with; hopefully cars would see.
    His easygoing but authoritative voice, pointing us to the nearest gas
    station that wasn't ripping us off, dissolved periodically into the harsh
    noise of another car speeding by—like a pan suddenly searing—but we smiled
    and nodded as if we heard with perfect alacritty. I'm sure we looked
    exactly the same in that moment. When he finally felt assured we wouldn't
    lose our way, we spent the last of our reserves thanking him with extra
    cheer, then rolled up our windows, sank back slowly into our seats, and
    exhaled. Probably both disconcerted and unable to remember what to resume
    feeling about each other. But defeated by the wait and epic directions to
    somewhere we weren't going, we gave up on reaching Montreal that night.
    She booked an inn at the nearest exit and we checked in, hungry and
    feeling unaccomplished.
  </p>

  <p>
    We found that restaurants up here closed early. The nearest grocery store
    was another exit over—an upstate exit. And the car felt equally as far,
    sitting on a second-story hotel bed. The room was sterile—in decor, in
    sound—except for a portrait on the wall of a clear, cold-looking lake
    reflecting a cloudless sky, mountains around it lush in Autumn reds and
    oranges. We had originally planned to set out early tomorrow morning for a
    hike and lakeside picnic, maybe somewhere like that, in the outskirts of
    Montreal. "We have to get our cooler and put the meats in the fridge," I
    said, remembering. A trip back to the car after all. I was about to get up
    when she said, "Do you think we can cook here?" We did bring a portable
    burner. I looked around the room and spotted a modern fire sprinkler. "I
    don't know if we should risk it." She was searching for an outlet near the
    window. "Hey, there's a roof outside our window." I walked over as she
    worked the latch. The window swung wide open, unlike windows in the city,
    rousing a shared instinct in us to climb through.
  </p>

  <p>
    The summer day was beginning to cool but a warm breeze took us by the arms
    and received us amiably as we stepped out of the relatively frigid air
    conditioned room. The rural quiet was dotted by the arythmic chirping of a
    few song sparrows. Beyond the edge of the roof, a darkening green and
    evening-blue field of grass stretched half a mile out, then rose up into a
    shadowy wall of maple and pine whose tops were catching the light of a
    sunset we couldn't see, coming from the other side of the hotel. "I don't
    think anyone can see us if we stay near the window," she said, "Eat out
    here?" I nodded, still looking at the striking light on tops of trees.
  </p>

  <p>
    As she started the burner outside, I poured some wine we'd brought for the
    picnic into tiny paper cups and reached out the window to set one down
    near her. She stopped her task to take a sip, motioning a subtle cheers
    before she drank. One at a time I placed our dinner materials outside—the
    marinated meats, a container of sliced vegetables, cutlery, my wine—and
    then climbed out with some napkins in hand. I was becoming a little
    self-conscious of the mess we were making on the roof, but she seemed
    unconcerned, which, I noted, mattered more. Soon everything was cooking.
    We wiped our hands and looked back out into the field, the sizzling of the
    grill doing a heroic job emulating the buzz of lively conversation. I
    noticed I was feeling strangely light, despite getting us stranded. Wary
    of a disconnect between us, I decided to wait for her to say something
    first.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the language of eating isn't so easy to restrain. We didn't know
    another way to eat off the grill than to pick out the best pieces to put
    on each other's plate. Each repetition alluding to a desire we couldn't
    say. Although ravenous by then, we ate with reserve. Until slowly our
    motions began to recover their spring, as if in between each bite we'd
    been throwing off layers of heavy clothing. We both seemed to wait for a
    chance to pour the other more wine. The sun having set, our eyes adjusted
    to the evening shade, rendering all parts of the field more fairly so it
    now felt like we were inside it. We began to recline more comfortably,
    leaving leftovers to cool on the grill—its buzzing now continued by an
    evening chorus of insects. "That was good," she said unexpectedly. I
    replied simply, "That was very good." We sat a while, each letting out a
    sigh as we gazed out into the field, the wine and air mingling at the
    surface of our skin in perfect balance.
  </p>

  <p>
    A time came amidst the afterglow when a touch of sadness meandering
    through the air passed through both of us. The beginning of the feeling
    when you don't want something to end, so you hurry to redraw your
    attention, wanting to take in what you still can. But it wasn't hard to
    let the sound of crickets pull us back in, the cohort singing surely
    against the fading backdrop. We each let out another sigh and continued
    floating, this time better prepared for an ending.
  </p>

  <p>
    The breeze picked up, and something made me feel that I should take the
    initiative. I started,
  </p>

  <p>"I'm sorry about this morning."</p>

  <p>"No..." she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have gotten so frustrated."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have taken it personally."</p>

  <p>"It's easy to when someone's being like me."</p>

  <p>
    "No, it's not just you. It's how anger sounds to me. Like it's at me. I
    was always like this—even before we met."
  </p>

  <p>"I think that's normal."</p>

  <p>
    "Maybe," she said absently, then adding, "I know you didn't grow up with
    that."
  </p>

  <p>
    I acknowledged with silence, letting the words spread their weight,
    wanting to give as much as she was giving but finding nothing to match.
    Car doors shut on the other side of the hotel. We seemed to sit stiller
    than before, as if afraid to prompt an ending, both searching for
    something that was missed. The muffled voices soon disappeared into the
    lobby. An ending felt imminent, so I continued, hoping to find direction
    along the way,
  </p>

  <p>
    "But, I can do better. I wasn't at my best this morning. I don't know what
    it was."
  </p>

  <p>
    "No—me too. I thought about this morning though—we were both under
    pressure." You're right, I thought, I hadn't realized.
  </p>

  <p>"Where were you today?" I asked.</p>

  <p>
    She thought. "I wasn't really upset the whole day. I know I seemed like
    it. But— I don't know. I should have said more, sorry."
  </p>

  <p>
    "It's okay," I said, wanting and not wanting to press. I rubbed my arms
    and shifted my position—it was getting chilly. Did we stray too far from
    the glow? I felt around for a way back.
  </p>

  <p>
    "If we could start the day over," she offered, "I can imagine how much
    better we'd do."
  </p>

  <p>
    Yeah, I thought. Then I said, a little delayed, "Yeah— I'd like to try
    that fight again." She let out a small laugh.
  </p>

  <p>"I'm sure you'll get to try again soon," she said. I laughed too.</p>

  <p>
    I poured the last of the wine, our cups now giving us a definite sense of
    the ending. We didn't delay nor hurry.
  </p>

  <p>"Wasn't exactly the picnic we planned, was it?"</p>

  <p>She laughed, "Why was it so good?"</p>

  <p>"I know. We should just head home, the trip peaked." We laughed.</p>

  <p>"Home does sound really nice right now," she said, smiling.</p>

  <p>
    Somewhere during our talking the choir of insects might have noticed two
    strangers of curious tone, and drifted farther upfield like a wandering
    shadow, unconsciously and without animosity. In the light of the window,
    we had become the portrait—the scene for the evening to see. The breeze
    now gently ushering us back inside.
  </p>

  <p>"I know you were joking, but we should still go," she said.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, of course."</p>

  <p>I saved the last sip of wine for something; now seemed the time.</p>

  <p>"To Canada then, where we'll do a little better."</p>

  <p>"To Canada."</p>

  <h1 id="the-wildfire">The Wildfire</h1>

  <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">I.</p>

  <p>
    K—, do you remember the wildfire on highway 101? And how you had that tattered blue quilt blanket in your trunk because you never knew where in your house to put it? And those sample-sized bottles of champagne they were just giving away at that liquor store, the beach town before. I remember it so vividly—handing you one end of the blanket and shaking it out together—the thorny yellow grass we draped it over—a patch of refuge, we created—us plopping down, you already peeling the foil from a bottle—then succeeding, and handing it to me. We felt lucky, didn't we? Ahead of us, miles of cars sitting single-file, engines killed, stranded on a two-lane highway pinned between mountains and the Pacific ocean. What if the fire were to reach us? We shrugged and laughed. "Guess we'll just die," I'm pretty sure you said. So it was—the epidemic of being in our 20s. Drinking champagne with our shoes off and saying we'd rather be stuck for longer so we'd catch the sunset. But you know, when we sat down, we barely talked—maybe feeling, in a lofty sort of way, that there was no need of words. But now I look back and think it was something else, like, we'd set the stage too grand—too grand to invite ordinary conversation. Because I remember, not long after, a cloud briskly overtaking the sun and casting the vista in shade, the novelty of our defiance suddenly seeming to wane, and my next sigh feeling naked and self-conscious. Families in their cars who we fancied wanted to join us (didn't we feel ready to share?), now we imagined rolling their eyes behind us and looking away. We took shyer sips of champagne. But as happens so often—or was it just me?—as quickly as the shade painted over us it seemed, we seemed to paint easily over ourselves, unconsciously recasting our roles and recent history. We were now just bystanders making the best of a situation—sitting hunched and hugging our knees, admiring the view in solemn optimism.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ah well, who in their 30s can't relate? And something we can all relate to is, ultimately, forgivable—forgivable and forgiven. Sometimes though, we can't relate. I've wondered a lot these days: Why are we so quick to ostracize someone for an error we simply can't relate to? What fault is it of theirs that we're the ones who don't understand? I smile writing this, for the irony of falling back to the "philosophical" language of our teenage years. We spoke it so sincerely, upon a time. But no, I ask seriously, because... well, I'm writing to you now because I wanted to tell you how, on that day of the wildfire on 101, I couldn't tell you how, 2,638 miles away an Uber driver in Manhattan was boarding his flight to come kill me.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">II.</p>

  <p>
    I'm sitting here and, I can't seem to get started—starting at the beginning where I should, way back in Kostya's basement. I guess I'm more used to telling a story when I feel like it—when one comes to me to be let out. For me at least, I feel like memories choose their own time to come alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    So let me just start with the one that's knocking now.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't know if you'd remember but, there was a day you agreed to swap shifts with Lindsey and work the afternoon instead of your usual evening. So we said we'd hang out when you got home. Those were the days when you'd text me just as you were getting out of work, and I'd order Carmella's and have the food laid out in a circle around your spot on the couch. Oh, you'd definitely remember, because: It was the day you burst through the front door and flung your purse across the room, shouting, "Yay! Home!"—except the purse opened mid-air and everything spilled out all over the living room. I remember looking at the debris field and then looking at you with my mouth still hanging open. You just laughed and said, "Great! I'm gonna ignore that," and walked straight to the bedroom to change into your comfy clothes. Later we were watching TV surrounded by a mess of containers and paper bags and the contents of your purse still on the floor—that's when the call came. The caller ID read "David" with no last name. I remember realizing who it was and being surprised his number survived all these years, changing phones, even carriers. I probably gave you a look as I picked up.
  </p>

  <p>"Hello?"</p>

  <p>I waited a second.</p>

  <p>"Hey, A—."</p>

  <p>
    I mean, maybe. Maybe that's how it went. To some degree I have to make this up—because I remember feeling feelings and thinking thoughts but not always the exact words I was hearing or saying. On the other hand, there are inconsequential moments I remember in unreasonable detail, like how hard it was to push myself up with one hand—the other hand holding the phone—out of that plush, deep-seated couch of yours—while gesturing to you that I was going to the bedroom—you nodding "of course"—and taking a step when a jolt ran up my leg and I yelled,
  </p>

  <p>"Ow! F—!"</p>

  <p>
    Whatever it was from your purse—but, that's why I remember it was that day. I remember saying through my teeth, "Sorry, give me one sec," and hurrying to the bedroom, stepping with one edge of my foot, but it wasn't my pain that was on my mind. I was gripped by a foreboding, I think because Dave didn't laugh or even say anything—he was just quiet through all of that. When I reached the bedroom—and remember how your TV was still kinda loud even from the bedroom?—I continued,
  </p>

  <p>
    "Hey, sorry about that. It's been so long man, what's up? How ya been?" Pretending I didn't suspect anything.
  </p>

  <p>"Hey A—, sorry if I'm interrupting something."</p>

  <p>"No, not at all. Just watching TV."</p>

  <p>
    There was a pause. I thought: Was he drunk? It was around eleven on the East Coast—not an unlikely hour to be, if that's where Dave still lived. I asked,
  </p>

  <p>"Hey, you alright? Something happen?"</p>

  <p>
    "No... I mean, yeah. Or..." he stammered. A sharp inhale. "No, nothing's happened. Well..." he said trailing off with an unconvincing laugh, then, "Not yet at least."
  </p>

  <p>
    I remember suddenly wanting absolute silence. Some cartoon character on Adult Swim was obnoxiously bleating profanities. I said to Dave, "Hey, really sorry. Let me go somewhere I can actually be alone. Give me a minute," and I walked—
  </p>

  <p>
    God, I know—walking here, walking there—what am I telling you all this for? But... can you bear with me? It's hard to tell this story at all, because the fact of what happened was told in a single sentence on some hospital's notes, but the way that it happened wrote all over me. The thing is, around the time of that wildfire and especially the years after, there was this purge in my brain that got underway, burning away memories that, I guess, felt too hard to keep. But, remember when we were driving to the wrong Idyllwild, how you got to telling me about the house you grew up in—and you were just musing about some toy you vaguely remembered having, but it somehow turned into you sobbing about your sister on the highway? And we pulled over? Kinda like then, I'm finding out that—in the uninteresting details of life, memories go to hide and survive—forested safely in peripheral flora—so maybe I'm walking here, walking there, walking along the brushes, hoping to find the pieces I need, to tell this story.
  </p>

  <p>So bear with me?</p>

  <p>
    I asked Dave to give me a minute and walked back out through the living room to get to the garage. I remember pointing to the garage but you didn't look—you were smiling at the TV, which gave me such relief for some reason that I started tiptoeing toward the garage, hoping to remain unseen. And in the garage it went something like this:
  </p>

  <p>"Hey, okay, what's going on, man? You okay?" I do remember asking again accidentally.</p>

  <p>
    "I'm uh..." And he'd forgotten he already answered. "Sorry," he laughed, oddly normal-sounding all of a sudden, "It's a tricky question sometimes."
  </p>

  <p>"Ha, yeah."</p>

  <p>
    "Hey," he sounded determined to get on with it, "I'm sorry to call you out of the blue. And I'm sorry... for the reason I'm calling you."
  </p>

  <p>
    I wondered if something happened to one of our friends. I thought Jaime—you remember Jaime—because I met Dave through Jaime back in high school.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I uh—I mean, I have to explain why still, but you just sorta popped into my head, and—" He was back to hesitating.
  </p>

  <p>"It's all good man, I don't mind. Tell me, what's up?"</p>

  <p>
    Each passing second suggested a wildly different story. Surely it couldn't be that hard to share a friend's passing? Unless he was still in shock—did it just happen? But no, troubled as he was, he sounded too resigned—like something inevitable and known had come to pass.
  </p>

  <p>"I don't know if you remember—some of the things we used to talk about—at Kostya's."</p>

  <p>I thought. So, nothing's happened?</p>

  <p>"Yeah, of course. I mean, we talked a lot—probably don't remember it all but, yeah. Why?"</p>

  <p>
    A short pause, then he continued, "Well, it was something you said actually. Way back then. And it kinda stuck with me—it's been coming up. Or—it came up suddenly, but I guess it means it stuck with me."
  </p>

  <p>
    Did I say something so prophetic, what, eight?—nine years ago? Because—right—the year I got my learner's permit, is when I began to sneak out late and drive to Kostya's. I'd purposely park the car a house or two away from mine, earlier in the day, so the engine's ignition wouldn't wake my mom or sister. I'd wait to turn on the headlights until I was over the hill. And sometimes I'd swing by Jaime's to pick him up too, because his car was boxed in on his parents' driveway. But anyway, nothing we said back then was likely to have any real, experiential weight. We were just young and testing our wits, and trying out new voices under the influence of our parents' liquor we took turns stealing. But I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel a little flattered.
  </p>

  <p>"Oh yeah? What did I say?"</p>

  <p>
    "We were... talking about Jesse's older brother—around the time he attempted, if you remember. And we were talking about what people should or shouldn't say to him. You spoke up—and, you were kinda soft-spoken back then so everyone shut up when you spoke—I mean not just because—but you didn't say things often—and you said, in this intense kinda way, that... someone thinking about suicide doesn't need another person telling them not to."
  </p>

  <p>
    "Yeah..." I said, not remembering the episode, but the sentiment familiar. I remember becoming aware of how intensely blue-white the light was in your garage, shining on white metal appliances and soaking into the gray concrete—such a stark contrast to the warm yellows inside your house.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You know," Dave continued, "being honest, we knew. People were actually really worried for you. But we never brought it up, because we didn't want to... you know. We wanted to be the ones who understood."
  </p>

  <p>
    It was a weird feeling, imagining the group—sitting around the pool table in Kostya's basement—looking at each other seriously and talking about me. It felt a little unbelievable I could have held such significance—I didn't contribute much to the group. When my attention returned to Dave, the weird feeling turned into a slight vertigo, like I was the one who'd called Dave for help, and he was here, consoling me.
  </p>

  <p>"Anyway, that's not why I called. Well, maybe it does help explain. Sorry, let me get to the point."</p>

  <p>"No, it's fine... Thanks for telling me that."</p>

  <p>
    One last pause (I think). "So... you've probably pieced it together"—I hadn't—I was still emerging from the past—and, I didn't start my story in Kostya's basement so you can't understand this right now but, I was also struck by the mention of Kostya—"but, I'm... not going to be around much longer. I'm happy with—I mean I'm—well, I don't have to explain it to you. That's kind of why I called you. I know you're not going to beg me to live, or call 911. Not that you know where I am anyway."
  </p>

  <p>Was I silent out of respect? Or was I paralyzed?</p>

  <p>
    "I don't know. I don't want to explain why, what I feel, to anyone. I don't want to have to explain. I feel tired. I just want to be allowed to... you know." He sounded more relaxed now—more sure of himself. "So look—I'm sorry again, about this—I'm in a Hilton right now—in a bathtub. And I'm ready. Or, I thought I was but, then, I felt like talking to someone. But you know, not like someone panicking on the phone, begging me not to do it. What a shitty mood to go out in, ha. And—people, you know, can't really hear you. But I remembered you, and I was sure for some reason it'd be different. So... I called. It just sorta overtook me, the feeling that, it would feel nice to talk to someone before I left. I also realize... how fucked up this is."
  </p>

  <p>I had had some time to prepare my next words.</p>

  <p>"It's okay man, I'm glad you called... I'm sorry man, it sounds like it's been a rough time."</p>

  <p>
    "No... not really. Y— That's what's hard to explain, right? It doesn't feel rough—it's just that you feel nothing—and somehow it's unbearable, day after day—I mean, you can call that rough but, it doesn't feel very rough at all, I don't know."
  </p>

  <p>
    "No, yeah," I said for now, even though that wasn't really my brand of the tendency. Mine had been more fiery—with a cast of actors in a dramatic world—my mom, my father, my sister, romantic interests (and their crushing disinterest), society, "they"—so actually my problem was almost the opposite: I felt too much, all of the time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ha, I know reading that just now made you raise your eyebrows and smile and go, "Yup," am I right? I'm laughing remembering all the times you'd talk to me like you would to a toddler, "Well someone's having big feelings today, aren't they?"
  </p>

  <p>Am I crazy to laugh in the middle of telling about this phone call? The brain can really be something...</p>

  <p>No, it's because I know how the story ends. I asked,</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you've tried meds—but didn't really help?"</p>

  <p>
    "Worse man, worse... One made me terrified to go to sleep, like every night. Another gave me anxiety attacks—that's when I started smoking a lot of weed."
  </p>

  <p>"I mean, that's the definition of rough, man."</p>

  <p>"I guess you're right."</p>

  <p>[A little more dialogue here.]</p>

  <p>
    You remember weird things, moments like these. I remember looking down at my curled toes—I remember how cold the concrete floor felt in your garage. Or, now that I think of it, maybe my whole body was just contracted—must have been stress, right? I'm scrunching up writing this right now—I think I was stressed. Which reminds me exactly of what Dave said:
  </p>

  <p>"No homo," he laughed, "you have an incredibly soothing voice in situations like these."</p>

  <p>"Ha, think I should work for the suicide hotline?"</p>

  <p>"I mean, you'd have a pretty shitty resume after you let me die."</p>

  <p>We laughed genuinely.</p>

  <p>I asked, "I'm curious, you ever call them?"</p>

  <p>"No, you?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Hard to imagine what they could possibly say that you haven't already heard, right?"</p>

  <p>
    "Yeah," I said, and then, maybe wanting desperately for us to laugh again, I tried, "Well, how do you know they don't all sound like me?"
  </p>

  <p>But he took it seriously.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I kinda doubt that man... I'm glad you're you."</p>

  <p>I felt like I was supposed to say thanks but it didn't come out. We were quiet for a while.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to keep you."</p>

  <p>"Dude. I'm never going to hear from you again. I have time."</p>

  <p>A moment later, "Thanks."</p>

  <p>
    Maybe this is the moment that your washing machine got burned into the retina of my mind. I was standing motionless, almost unblinking, regulating my breath to be steady and deathly silent, afraid that even a tinge of alarm would scare him away, feeling at once that nothing could change and also that everything could change, and it all depended on me, but my mind was blanking, staring at this washing machine, sheet metal the coldest tone of white I'd ever seen, with a slight dimple on one face that reflected a glare of the fluorescent light. Whenever I think of this night, this washing machine is so vivid in my mind that I almost can't see what's actually in front of me.
  </p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to go," he said calmly.</p>

  <p>I searched desperately for a clue.</p>

  <p>"This was exactly what I needed. Thanks A—, I really appreciate it."</p>

  <p>
    I gave him exactly what he needed. Can you imagine, if I were to change course now and say, Wait, don't do it, right then? In fact it must seem like the obvious thing to do, but it's not, when you know how that loneliness feels—when having just one person you feel safe talking to, feels more precious than anything life has been offering you. Still, I remember being bewildered, Why don't I have another choice? Another voice in my head screaming, You do! Say something! But I'm walking us through these thoughts as if they happened sequentially—they didn't—they didn't need any "walking through" for me, because they were a single and instantaneous feeling, a memory already processed and ready-evoked—including the hunch that caving too early and asking Dave to reconsider, could flare up his defensive resolve to carry through, trigger despair at finding himself all alone again, and then...
  </p>

  <p>"No problem, Dave," I found myself saying. "We'll miss you." And finally, "But we'll be okay."</p>

  <p>"Thanks A—," he said.</p>

  <p>A second or two passed, then the call ended.</p>

  <p>
    For 30 seconds, I counted, frozen, still holding the phone to my head, my chest pounding—staring at that washing machine—commanding myself to wait—wait like I was observing an excruciating, but sacred, ritual.
  </p>

  <p>
    I blinked, then hit the call button twice with my thumb to call him back. A vertigo came over me thinking, What if I waited too long. Why did it have to be 30. Why not 20. The line was ringing—shame washed over me—What was I thinking?—and ringing—and ringing—and ringing—then it went to Dave's voicemail. The vertigo was merciless—would this be my last time hearing Dave's voice? And would it forever replay in my mind in the timbre of a phone's speaker and my regret.
  </p>

  <p>Then a call came in.</p>

  <p>From "David," no last name.</p>

  <p>I picked up.</p>

  <p>I said nothing at first. The line was quiet.</p>

  <p>Then it came flowing out.</p>

  <p>
    "Dave. I'm buying you a ticket, right now—a flight to San Diego, tonight. Are you in New York?"
  </p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>
    "Dave, I have an idea. Let's get away. I need to get away too—it's a long story. I've seen some beach towns on the coast of California that have cheap vacation rentals this time of the year. You know I won't tell anyone about this. So you can just disappear—forget New York, forget everything—let's just get away and hang out."
  </p>

  <p>No answer, but I knew he was there.</p>

  <p>Then finally, he said,</p>

  <p>"I need a few days... to pack. And put my dad's shotgun back."</p>

  <p>"That's fine, in a few days then. Three days good?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah."</p>

  <p>"Okay, I'm buying it now and I'll send you the flight details—wait, are you in New York?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. I'm in New York."</p>

  <p>"Okay, I'll be in touch. And I'll see you soon."</p>

  <p>A brief moment later, "Okay, see you soon."</p>

  <p>The call ended.</p>

  <p>
    I walked back in and closed the garage door behind me. Do you remember, then, asking me, "Anything the matter?" In the sing-song voice you use when you're hesitant to ask something. If you do remember, and you're confused, you're right to be. Because that's when I told you:
  </p>

  <p>
    My mom isn't handling things well. My sister is overwhelmed. I have to move back to New York for a while to take care of things.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">III.</p>

  <p>
    It wasn't a complete lie, but maybe those are worse—calculated to be just so. You have every right to be angry—I'm not writing asking to be forgiven—although partly I am writing to apologize—but I know my apology may mean nothing to you now, and anyway, no apology will be enough by the time you're done reading this letter.
