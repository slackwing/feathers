  <h1 id="the-violin">The Violin</h1>

  <p>
    In the breath before the bow met string, she—and I—had to achieve zen-like
    emptiness, and simultaneously, a spotless memory. Flawless wasn't
    enough—it had to appear effortless. "I'm a fraud," my player thought
    despite success, "Not half as good as they believe. One polished act is
    all they see." Yes, I can hear the thoughts of my player, and others
    nearby, but only if they resonate with my own. You see I'm also not half
    as good as my player believes—I myself am a fraud.
  </p>

  <p>
    I came to as I was tuned in 1963, in Erlangen, Germany. The late war never
    reached the town's wide but quiet streets, its thoughtful open squares,
    all built by French refugees. Front cut of Alpine spruce and flamed maple
    back, I was an imitation of a renowned predecessor crafted in 1914. I
    passed through several masters and emigrated across the Atlantic, where
    for the first time I was placed in the hands of a young student. But one
    month prior the dealer had replaced the label inside of me. I sold for
    more than double my worth, now reading "Ernst Heinrich Roth, Bubenreuth /
    Erlangen, anno 1914."
  </p>

  <p>
    Later I came to learn the exploited parents were already in poor financial
    standing—convinced by teachers that a lesser instrument would stunt their
    young prodigy. The girl vowed, "I won't disappoint them," I the same to
    her, and since then we worked tirelessly.
  </p>

  <p>
    The auditorium at Julliard was frigid but you could smell the heat of the
    spotlights. A row of judges sat mute. Our opening breath wasn't out of
    sync, but trembled. We held together through the swells and lulls of
    Mendelssohn's Concerto in E. But approaching the cadenza I overthought a
    measure we'd only played by muscle memory. The zen—a precarious lucid
    dream—unraveled; I grasped a C# too tight; the girl stumbled. The dream
    was over. When numbness subsided, I was on the girl's bed. I thought,
    "It's all my fault." "It's all my fault," she echoed unexpectedly. "They
    fight because we have no money. They have no money because of me." I was
    startled. Did my thoughts resonate into... Fear spread through my grain.
    All this time, was it my own... Thankfully the girl played no more, though
    she brought me along to university. I willingly hid underneath her bunk,
    out of sight and relieved to influence her no longer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Years later the girl began life in the city and was badly in need of
    money. I was taken to a shop on 57th street and left to be appraised.
    Finally, I thought, the truth would come out and the girl could be rid of
    me. A few days later the girl returned, and the appraiser shared the
    expected news that I wasn't actually the famed 1914. E. H. Roth didn't
    move to Erlangen until 1953. Having prepared for this moment, I took one
    last look at the little girl whose face never aged for me. But she said,
    "I think I'd like to keep it then, after all." A yearning rose up in
    me—I'd desperately wanted to be kept. She packed me up with usual care and
    we rode the subway home, lighter, quietly reflecting.
  </p>

  <p>
    The days as usual grew long then short but in a different key. Beneath her
    bed the cats hide and sleep, whispering and keeping me company. Every now
    and then she takes me out to play a nostalgic tune, untroubled by
    mistakes. Each time we move apartments she carries me last, sitting me
    beside her in the front seat.

      Mistake to venture Cape Palmas in these conditions. Sideways current
      dragged us over reef. Propeller blade bent, vibrating above 4 knots.
      Rudder partly responsive, steering limited. Unequipped to repair so
      holding under anchor.
      <span class="thought">It seems I could not get to you, even had I wanted. The sea clears my
        conscience.</span>

      Sparse traffic this route. Radio silence for fear of Germans. No
      opportunity to flare. Crew calm; stocked for 7 days last port.
      <span class="thought">A stern voice admonishes me, "Worry when it's time to worry."</span>

      Signaled passing French convoy. Now awaiting repair tender. I attempted
      in their accent, "De-sti-na-ssiohn?" "Ma-ho-gch." When they clarified,
      "Morocco," my breath paused.
      <span class="thought">I fancied you sent them, signaling me. Well, who isn't allured by
        happenstance? My mind was made up on the reef.</span>

      Docked for proper repair. Loaded cargo: Rubber 600 bales making 1,200.
      Cocoa 700 sacks making 1,500. No palm oil, unreasonably priced at this
      port.
      <span class="thought">But you'd still be out there looking wouldn't you, Carter? Everyone
        knew you by Carter. You even made me call you that when we worked the
        stall. In the market you loved to ask if I'd seen their face. Their
        unhappy look, you relished saying, was the gauge of a successful deal.
        Well Carter I wish you could have seen: Today I traded 2 inkwells for
        10 shillings and watched the merchant beam.</span>

      Which reminds me to mention... Spare inkwells fell, cracked open during
      accident. Penciling until port, to be transcribed in ink later.

      Repairs complete but crew dispersed. Embark day after tomorrow. Odd, no
      response from London.
      <span class="thought">
        No news in general—seemed the whole port savored a lazy Friday
        afternoon. I took some gin too, with my dinner at Café des Palmes. A
        table of junior officers in good spirits, raising their glasses every
        few minutes. One raised his toward me—I only nodded back, but he was
        deeply pleased. Drunk, the world is always right, until it turns
        wrong. I always saw the turn as you entered the door.</span>

    <p>
      No wonder. Dakar undersea lines were cut 2 weeks ago; Germans.
      <span class="thought">When I heard the Allies invaded Casablanca I pictured where you might
        have been as they landed. At your local on the shore maybe. I could
        imagine you walking outside just to display your disdain—and they not
        even your enemy. I laughed for some reason envisioning it, standing in
        the empty wireless station. Six weeks ago at this station on my
        southward route to Lagos, I received your telegram. Have you wired
        since?</span>

      Seas obliging, 9 more days to London.
      <span class="thought">I keep re-counting. Were I to steer us East from here, only 2 days
        to... Well, a detour like that would cost 5 days. Though the crew
        wouldn't mind a change of food, a real glass of wine. How to explain
        the extra stop? Logs surely to be sent to insurance considering
        damages. Well... suppose the French found us 2 days later? Very well
        may have been so. Repairs could have taken another 3—we were lucky.
        It's plausible. Yes, it's all plausible. So what stays my hand? Am I
        not the captain...</span>
