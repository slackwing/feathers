# Sentence Segmenter Specification

**Keep this document terse - only enough to capture every segmenter rule.**

---

## Core Principles

### Nesting Pattern (CRITICAL)

**Rule:** Any nested structure that begins at the top level stays as ONE sentence.

**Nested structures:**
- Parentheticals: `(text)`
- Editorial brackets: `[text]`
- Quotes: `"text"`
- Italicized thoughts: `*text*`

**Depth:** Only 1 level deep

**Implication:** No splitting within any nesting. Even if the nested content contains periods, exclamation points, or question marks, the entire structure (including surrounding context) remains one sentence.

**Examples:**
- `Sentence. (Parenthetical with period.) Continuation.` = ONE sentence
- `Text [editorial note.] more text.` = ONE sentence
- `Before "quote. Another sentence." after.` = ONE sentence

## Rule Categories

### 1. Structural Boundaries

| Pattern | Description | Test Scenarios | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| `\n\n` | Double newline always creates boundary (paragraphs, sections) | 001 | HIGH |
| `\n\t` | Tab-indented paragraph break always creates boundary | 012 | HIGH |
| Markdown headers | Lines starting with `#` are separate segments (boundary before and after) | 001, 057 | HIGH |

### 2. Dialogue & Quotation Rules

| Pattern | Description | Test Scenarios | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| `"quote" <pronoun> <attribution_verb>` | Quote + attribution stays together (e.g., "Hello." he said.) BUT period after attribution ends sentence | 006 | HIGH |
| `\n"quote"` or `\n\t"quote"` | Quote starting on new line creates boundary before quote | 004, 005 | HIGH |
| `"quote!"` embedded in sentence | Quote with internal punctuation but embedded in sentence doesn't split | 003 | MEDIUM |
| Multi-sentence quote | Entire quote stays as ONE sentence, even with internal `.!?` | 031 | HIGH |
| `*italic thought*` | Italics used for internal thoughts follow SAME rules as quotes | 016 | HIGH |
| Split quote with attribution | `"part1," he said, "part2."` stays as ONE sentence - attribution search stops at next quote | 056 | HIGH |

**Attribution verbs:** said, asked, replied, stammered, shouted, whispered, muttered, continued, added, explained

**Pronouns:** he, she, I, they, we, you

**Italic thought patterns:** Internal monologue in italics treated identically to quoted dialogue for boundary detection.

### 3. Punctuation Context Rules

| Pattern | Description | Test Scenarios | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| `...` (ellipsis) | Ellipsis does NOT create sentence boundary | 002, 006 | HIGH |
| `. ` (period + space) | Default boundary unless in exception context | All | MEDIUM |
| `.\n` (period + newline) | Boundary at period followed by newline | Multiple | MEDIUM |
| `! `, `? ` | Exclamation/question + space creates boundary | 003 | MEDIUM |
| `!\n`, `?\n` | Exclamation/question + newline creates boundary | Multiple | MEDIUM |
| `:` (colon) | Colon does NOT create boundary (transparent) | TBD | MEDIUM |
| `;` (semicolon) | Semicolon does NOT create boundary (transparent) | TBD | LOW |
| `—` (em-dash) | Em-dash is transparent (ignore for boundaries) except at `\n\n` | TBD | HIGH |
| Abbreviations with `.` | Period after abbreviation does NOT create boundary | TBD | MEDIUM |

### 4. Exception Contexts (Boundary Inhibitors)

| Context | Rule | Test Scenarios | Priority |
|---------|------|----------------|----------|
| Inside quoted text | No splitting on internal punctuation | 003 | HIGH |
| Ellipsis pattern | `...` followed by space or punctuation is NOT boundary | 002, 006 | HIGH |
| Quote + attribution | Pattern `"..." <pronoun> <verb>` blocks split after quote punctuation | 006 | HIGH |

---

## Abbreviations List (Hardcoded)

**Common titles:**
- Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr., Prof., Sr., Jr.

**Time expressions:**
- a.m., p.m., am, pm (no periods)

**Common abbreviations:**
- etc., vs., e.g., i.e., approx., govt.

**Single letters:**
- Single capital letter + period (e.g., `K.`, `A.`, `I.`) - context-dependent
- Exception: `I.` as Roman numeral at start of line IS a boundary

**Numbers/Measurements:**
- No., vol., ch., p., pp.

**Growing list:** Add to this as encountered in manuscript.

## Implementation Notes

### V3 Architecture (Current: 38/38 passing)

**3-Phase Pipeline:**
1. **Mark Nested Structures** - Find all quotes, parens, brackets, italics (position ranges, 1-level only)
2. **Mark Boundaries** - Apply 8 rules to identify split points (respecting nested regions)
3. **Split & Normalize** - Split at boundaries, normalize internal whitespace to spaces

**Critical details:**
- **Quote detection:** Straight quotes `"` toggle open/close; curly quotes `"` `"` explicit
- **Whitespace normalization:** Internal `\n` and `\t` → single space, collapse multiples
- **Attribution detection:** Check for verb + comma before `\n\t"quote"` pattern; stop search at next quote to preserve split quotes
- **Paragraph breaks:** Both `\n\n` and `\n\t` (when not dialogue) create boundaries
- **Markdown headers:** Lines starting with `#` create boundaries before and after

### Quote Classification
- **Standalone dialogue**: Quote on own line (`\n\t"..."`) without attribution before
- **Embedded dialogue**: Quote within ongoing sentence (e.g., after "shouting,")
- **Attributed dialogue**: Quote followed by `<pronoun> <verb>` pattern (or verb before)
