#### TODOs

| Part | Id | Description | Impact | Effort | Status |
| - | -: | - | -: | -: | -: |
| Tooling | SFT001 | Roughly write a first installer in install-karabiner-settings.tcl. | M | M | |
| Tooling | SFT002 | Factor out installer utils from install-karabiner-settings.tcl. | M | M | |


#### Patterns

1. Less READMEs, share by default, split when necessary; but always split decision logs.
1. Tooling: Always `install-foo.tcl`; always run-from-anywhere; built-in pre-reqs check (system, dependencies, paths, configs); auto-backup any modified files.
