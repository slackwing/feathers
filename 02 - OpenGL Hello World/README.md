## OpenGL Hello World

I was very surprised at how smooth it was to get started with OpenGL.

I just copied `main.cc` from the examples at https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/openglexamples/, then compiled with

    gcc -framework OpenGL -framework GLUT -o myprogram myprogram.c

as instructed in https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/opengl/.

It might have helped that I already had xcode installed on this computer.
