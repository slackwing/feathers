### Chapter 2

Marco watched a Marco he'd grown used to, a Marco he was just beginning to like, extinguish himself in Ally's eyes.

Marco will soon find himself in a new city.
One he'd never known until last year's Summer when he made a trip {for his office}.
There, during a Wednesday's afterwork drinks a colleague was joined by local friends, one of whom later turned to Marco with some insignificant but amiable chatter that compelled Marco too to turn, gradually toward this stranger.
I imagine the instant their angles mirrored, the room receded into a blur and its voices became murmurs, as happens when yet unacquainted but fated friends coincide.
By the end of the night, farewells were hardly heard behind the alacrity of each other's voices, one of which now invites Marco to an early Sunday dinner at a "Cate who's got a thing for dinner parties'" East R. apartment.
That Sunday afternoon patches of clouds formed magnified patches of shades over the city's sidewalks, and the humidity of the lake seemed to lift.
Marco decided to walk the 40 minutes to Cate's, across the pedestrian bridge and through a neighborhood with an array of cafes and boutiques facing the river.
Stopping for wine, Marco browsed thoughtfully, settling on a $33 red.
But he needn't have been so thoughtful. In crowds like Cate's—here and there sprinkled across cities like lights of street lamps that don't touch—there's an abundance of welcome and goodwill that puts you at ease, so your only concern becomes that of grateful alertness, to find a chance to reciprocate. No wonder when the next next Spring, ...

when Marco returns on business and texts his {acquaintance} after a great deal of hesitation (Marco had not kept in touch as he {emphatically} promised), only to hear his phone ring within the minute and, _"Marco! How have you been? ... Good, great! And your family in Georgia? ... mhm, that's so good to hear! ..."_, and when Igor [Marco's manager] half-heartedly floats by Marco a long-term assignment with a {paltry} relocation package, Igor will be {taken by surprise} by Marco's easy decision—easy as reading an epilogue of a story that ends well.

In three years while visiting New York with Cate, Marco will run into Ally on the very street corner he now approaches.
In this and that present, Marco stops. Pedestrians dip into his view from left and right.
They brandish their impatience with him by their swagger.
In this present, activity spurs in the realms between the folds of his brain, an astronomical task having just begun: a Great Rewriting of memories, complete with mistakes and {}, to resurface {transmuted} in the other present, bearing irregularities in Marco's universe like the outbursts of glitched words that escape us when {we recall embarrassing memories}.

But right now—now now—I'm not sure Marco felt any of that.
What did he feel, I try to recall.
He felt the breeze make his eyes feel like cold planets.
Then he felt a little ashamed—it all seemed a little melodramatic, didn't it?
So he smiled and picked up his pace across the street, looking easily left, looking easily right, as untroubled people do when they've nothing to look at at all.

_Perhaps what was said in this exchange will be one of the crucial pieces to the drama later. Perhaps Marco finds this stranger strangely easy to open up to, and they quickly find themselves sharing secrets, though vaguely. Less perhaps, maybe that stranger is me._

_Idea A7: Write more run-on, the more uncomfortable the character's psyche is. This gives you an excuse to write that way, or in other words, gives it form._

_Idea A8: Make the narrator become more and more real, either approaching the introduction of him, or in relation to time, e.g. "I was not there, then." Perhaps one chapter it catches up. Perhaps it is the chapter I commit suicide._

_Idea B1: Inspired by Calvino 192: The feeling when you blunder with a girl. But she calls on you the next day anyway. Unexpected resolution of tension. Maybe later realized as extreme Grace on her part. And like The Idiot, her explaining. "But I know you're sensitive and ..." Maybe a thread here can be: Sleeping with someone because it's not much to you, but a lot to the ego of a man._

### Chapter 7

And I remembered the night I met Marco being a night just like this.
Nearly every window on the street was alight so that there seemed a lively buzz any way one looked, imparting a neighborhoodly, generous mood that I didn't know to do what with, standing alone on the invisible driveway my eyes had not yet adjusted to.
Wanting to be a part of everything but not wanting to be a part of anything, I rejected all that glow around me and said I only wanted to hear the sounds the night truly did make.
So I coaxed my lungs to slow its pace and fixed my eyes toward the highway from where I came, with such intent that canine ears might have sprouted to cooperate.
Abruptly however, the night echoed nothing.
Not a distant break of an engine's wave, or the _dtee-rheet dtee-rheet_ of an insect's lave.
And the buzz returned, but now I could hear it was just the buzzing of my own brain.
Yes, now I remember, that's the thought that I had: Was it always just the buzzing of my own brain?
All this time mistaking it for company.

Softly popped the door behind me from its snug rubber nest.
I turned to see a figure cradle it back closed.
I think then seeing me, he hesitated, and probably we both regretted our coincidence, but not with any personal apprehension.
Indeed as he awkwardly found his footing atop the black pavement to come by me, it seemed as if an unspoken apology—I to him and he to me—had bound us already, to look after one another.

_Idea B2: I want to write about the things that are hard to speak, the things that we feel but can't seem to put to sense. And all the build-up of people's unspokens that come out to interact._


### Chapter 12

I sat on the barstool.
The brass pipe that lined the bar as a footrest had not extended to this corner—perhaps this area was intended as standing room—so my legs dangled awkwardly, making me feel childish and unprepared.
I shifted in my seat, crossing my legs and throwing an elbow over the seatback, relaxing my shoulders followed by my body into an unconcerned figure.

No, this wouldn't do. Unideal.

Conscious that she might walk in at any moment, I unconcernedly shifted my gaze across the bar to see if any other seats had opened up.
It seemed like a couple on the opposite end was about to settle up, but separated from me by a narrow corridor of patrons, some content to move periodically aside for traffic, others perhaps {waiting for a seat as well}. I'd risk losing both seats to try.

"Hey, Marco."

I'd forgotten to look unconcerned.

"Jules, hey. How's it going?"

"Not bad, you?"

"Yea, not bad either. Just sizing up tonight's crowd," I lifted my chin toward the couple who'd just gotten up, noticing no one swooped in for them.

She laughed. I was ready to improvise {[i.e. the kind and state of tonight's crowd]} but she didn't comment. (What did she think I meant?)

"{}[...]}"

_Idea A9: The point of this chapter is for the character to make blunders, and for it to seem like Jules is responding poorly because of those blunders, and for the character to end the night feeling bleak and stupid, but either at chapter's end or the beginning of the next chapter, Jules texting about another date. And how all one's doubts lifts in that moment. Then second-guessing: She's just being nice, etc. "Was she so graceful that she knew to bandage my feelings the sooner the better..."_

_Idea A10: When friends don't believe your special situation. When friends are tempted to say I-told-you-so, or the situation seems classic._

_Idea C1: Preface: I owe it to my book club [...] and this preface is really meant for them. They do not read prefaces nor even the backs of books, in the name of [...], but that's because they can't control what prefaces may spoil for them. But I can. And as tempting as it will be for them to maintain their [...], the thing is, they will only get to read this book by their friend for the first time, once. And so it should be more difficult to brazenly [...] To find a balance I've enlisted Brad's help [...]_

Chapter 11

"What a scene it would be if I crashed,"

I almost inhaled the last word.

Inside my mind, my head was already thrown back as I stared through the ceiling and into the night sky, my eyes fixed with exasperation, recalling the lesson I could not seem to learn. One simple thing: to think, for even half a second, before I spoke.
_Especially_ when things were fine.
That was the catch: to think, when there's no reason to.

You see, I wasn't trying to stay.
I wouldn't stake so much on such a teenage, last ditch effort when there were infinite opportunities to develop naturally after.
The manufacturer of jokes in my brain has a nervous tick, and {...}

"That'd be really, really bad. I'd offer otherwise."

"No, I'm kidding. I'd rather sleep—" I wasn't going to be able to stop, "—in my own bed."

That did it. The desperate attempt and the {facesaving}.

I had to admit, perhaps that's actually what happened. I mean, perhaps I did make the desperate attempt, and perhaps I automatically saved face, all without my knowing. But what convinced me otherwise was simply that I was not nervous through any of that exchange— ...
