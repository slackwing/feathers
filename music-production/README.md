Delaying a kick by a dotted eighth then running just the wet through far and wide convolver presets, seems to be a reliable way to create galloping, "industrial" hall kicks, with hat-like elements by side-effect. From this exploration I'd like to deliver a 5-minute demo of 10 different sounds I can make this way.

1. 00:00 - Low, 40 Hz kick w/ default convolver.
1. 00:32 - [707-ey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSDCXzcO5qM) kick w/ St. Paul's Cathedral.
1. 01:04 - Punchy kick w/ Bunker (B) crossfaded into Bunker (C).
1. 01:36 - Resonating LP evolved over 8 minutes, sniping out unpleasant frequencies. (Hearing only last 30 seconds.)
1. 01:54 - Retaining resonation and starting again, St. Paul's Cathedral again.
1. 02:15 - Placing a phaser before the delay.
1. 02:47 - Flipping LP to HP.
1. 03:19 - Some other cathedral, reverse-sniping the woodblock tone, and some EQ.

Notes
- Try all the variations of a set of convolver presets, because certain ones can bring out a certain tone that sounds very nice. I favor the church presets.
- There was a very, very specific convolver stretch % (like 116% for VMH2 Bassdrum 01) where the kick became completely different, gaining bass somehow.

## General Tips

- "Silence"

    - Flip an LP to HP.
    
- Background Tone

    - Send to some noise-generating effect like a phaser, then reverse-snipe frequency with Parametric EQ 2.

## FL Studio Tips

- Workflow

    - Automation Clip > Articulator Tools > Copy | Paste State. Copy automation drawings to unrelated clips.
    - Patcher to create sound templates!
    - Edison in Insert to record generation.
    - Snipe frequencies using Parametric EQ 2 with precision frequency killer at narrowest width.

    - Extend selection with Ctrl.

- UI

    - Clean up Plugin Database > Effects | Generators to reduce menu items. They'll still exist in Installed.

- Aesthetic

    - Convolver > View > Display > Temperature
