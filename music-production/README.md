Delaying a kick by a dotted eighth then running just the wet through far and wide convolver presets, seems to be a reliable way to create galloping, "industrial" hall kicks, with hat-like elements by side-effect. From this exploration I'd like to deliver a 5-minute demo of 10 different sounds I can make this way.

Demo
1. 00:00 - Low, 40 Hz kick w/ default convolver.
1. 00:32 - [707-ey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSDCXzcO5qM) kick w/ St. Paul's Cathedral (distant rear).
1. 01:04 - Standard, punchy kick w/ Bunker (B) crossfaded into Bunker (C).

Notes
- Try all the variations of a set of convolver presets, because certain ones can bring out a certain tone that sounds very nice. I favor the church presets.
- Can entire songs be created just from "grafting" this sound over and over again?

### MIDI Helper Ideas

- Permamap next / previous preset. (It does exist!)
- Quickmap common effect knobs like delay LP CF & resonance.

### FL Studio Tips

- Workflow

    - Automation Clip > Articulator Tools > Copy | Paste State. Copy automation drawings to unrelated clips.
    - Patcher to create sound templates!

- UI

    - Clean up Plugin Database > Effects | Generators to reduce menu items. They'll still exist in Installed.

- Aesthetic

    - Convolver > View > Display > Temperature
