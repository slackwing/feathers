=== new mantra 12/14/2025

If you don't feel like doing anything, check your stomach and relax.
If you feel like you need _some_ reward, reflect on how life has been _un_rewarding.
Then maybe realize it has been and be grateful.
Or if not, imagine prisoners and slaves and refugees; thicken your skin for unrewardedness.
Not by saying it's okay and everything is good. But by saying you can handle it.
Start the workout even if you hate the idea of it and feel it's an opposite reward.
Consider going for a run; maybe you need novelty.
Remember your current specialness:
- Number theory and quantum mechanics.
- Enemies and neighbors (good for perspective).
- Keeping up with Book Club reading.
- Playing Emily King with Abi.
- Practice; you are a musician on Spotify.
Depending on how AI goes, there may be rough times ahead. Savor these days.
