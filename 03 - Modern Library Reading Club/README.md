### The "Modern Library Reading Club" ([mlrc.nyc](https://mlrc.nyc))

The group formed in 2015 when my far-away friend Brad suggested keeping in touch by reading [Modern Library's 100 Best Novels](http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/) together, but from shortest to longest. The idea being, no matter how diligiently we each read until we died, we'd hardly make a dent in all there is to read; but we might at least broaden our sense of what's out there by getting through as many "classics" as we can. So, quantity over (time discerning) quality.

Over the years we'd grown in membership and experimented with lots of ways to nominate and select books, expanding to contemporary award-winners as well as collections of short stories, translated foreign-language novels, historical fiction, and even graphic novels. The group's kept up a weekly meet-up, usually dividing books across 3 weeks, and each meet-up starting with everyone's "general impressions" (10-15 mins) then going into "highlights" (30-45 mins) that often sparked related (and plenty of unrelated) discussions. 

IMHO though, the reason to read has never been for reading itself, even when we thought it was. ~It's the friends we made along the way ðŸŒˆ~ Lol, no, but looking back at what a menagerie of conditions and people and luck it took to keep life flowing through a book club week after week, it seems like a waste not to consolidate some of the tips and tricks I'd gleaned.

### Hosting an IRL Book Club

Once Brad and I were in the same city, we began to meet IRL at a [barbeque joint](https://www.yelp.com/biz/john-brown-smokehouse-long-island-city-3), sometimes a hostel lobby. But once we had 4 or 5 regulars and until I passed the reins a few years later, _i.e._ from 2016 to 2019, we met at my apartment every Tuesday.
