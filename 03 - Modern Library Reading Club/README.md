#### What it is and what this is

In 2015 my then-far-away friend Brad suggested keeping in touch by reading [Modern Library's 100 Best Novels](http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/) together, but in order from shortest to longest. His idea being, no matter how diligiently we read until we died, we'd hardly make a dent in all there is to read; but we might at least broaden our sense of what's out there by getting through as many "classics" as we can. So: quantity over (time discerning) quality.

Over the years the reading group grew and experimented with lots of ways to nominate and select books, expanding to contemporary award-winners as well as collections of short stories, translated foreign-language novels, historical fiction, and even graphic novels. The group's kept up a weekly meet-up, usually dividing books across 3 weeks, and each meet-up starting with everyone's "general impressions" (10-15 mins) then going into "highlights" (30-45 mins) that often sparked related (and plenty of unrelated) discussions. 

IMHO though, the reason to read has never been for reading itself, even when we thought it was. ~It's the friends we made along the way ðŸŒˆ~ Lol, no, but looking back at what a menagerie of conditions and people and luck it took to keep life flowing through a book club week after week, it seems like a waste not to consolidate some of the tips and tricks I'd gleaned.

#### Hosting a book club

Once Brad and I were in the same city, we began to meet IRL at a [barbeque joint](https://www.yelp.com/biz/john-brown-smokehouse-long-island-city-3), sometimes a hostel lobby. But once we had 4 or 5 regular members and until I handed over the reins a few years later, _i.e._ from 2016 to 2019, we met at my apartment every Tuesday.
