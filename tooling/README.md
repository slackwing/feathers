_**2020 Jul 27.** Choosing [Tcl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) over [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) because (1) it's ridiculously [minimal](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/contents.htm), (2) it's remained the same (8.x) since 1997, and (3) it's a unique language to practice in 2020, I think._
