### Tooling

1. Install `zsh`:
    - https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#basic-installation
    - https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k
    - https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k
    - `ln -f ~/.zshrc ~/src/feathers/tooling/`
    - Only modify `.zshrc` locally (not from GitHub or other machines), or pulling will overwrite the hardlink.

### Log

_**2020 Aug 07.** Let's give zsh a shot. There's no reason not to. I can always develop shell scripts in and for bash if I wanted to._

_**2020 Jul 27.** Choosing [Tcl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) over [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) because (1) it's ridiculously [minimal](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/contents.htm), (2) it's remained the same (8.x) since 1997, and (3) it's a unique language to practice in 2020, I think._
