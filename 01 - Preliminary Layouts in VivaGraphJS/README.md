## Preliminary Layouts in VivaGraphJS

- Even with today's computing power, drawing a graph of 65,000 nodes can take minutes or crash the browser. 
- As of 2019, Andrei Kashcha's VivaGraphJS seemed the fastest library for drawing large graphs. [His video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax7KSQZ0_hk) (2014) has a nice comparison of 12 libraries.
- [Here's](#todo) the default force-directed algorithm running on a subgraph of [5xa273c](#todo).
- [Here's](#todo) the same running on the entire graph of [5xa273c](#todo). It seems like it'll practically never settle, and may not even reach an optimal settlement.
- I believe being able to specify my own preliminary layout before force-direction would greatly help.
- Attempts were made but there were many problems. _Todo: Describe attempts, check in code._
