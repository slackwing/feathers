  question: When was Hamas created (or announced) and under what conditions.
  answer: Mid-December 1987. A decade before in 1978, the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood made advances, e.g. founding the Islamic University in Gaza. This group focused on promoting Islam through building mosques, schools, health-care institutions, charitable bodies, and kindergartens, and gained traction (sapping control from the PLO). But the Islamists eventually were indoctrinated 'towards fanatic zeal.' It was from this generation of Islamists that Hamas was founded, initially led by Yassin, who led the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood before.

  question: "What act of terrorism occurred in 1985?"
  answer: The Palestinian Liberation Front hijacked a cruise liner and launched a seaborne raid on Israel, weakening Arafat's (PLO) position, dialogue with US being suspended at the behest of Israel. This would lead to Arafat siding with Baghdad and Saddam Hussein, who offered the most financial support to the PLO by far than other Arab states.
