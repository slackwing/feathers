  question: When was Hamas created (or announced) and under what conditions.
  answer: Mid-December 1987. A decade before in 1978, the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood made advances, e.g. founding the Islamic University in Gaza. This group focused on promoting Islam through building mosques, schools, health-care institutions, charitable bodies, and kindergartens, and gained traction (sapping control from the PLO). But the Islamists eventually were indoctrinated 'towards fanatic zeal.' It was from this generation of Islamists that Hamas was founded, initially led by Yassin, who led the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood before.

  question: What dramatic and ceremonial event attracted intense media coverage on 31 October 1991?
  answer: The Madrid peace conference; the first of many Madrid talks. "Madrid went a long way toward repairing some of the damage caused by the Gulf war, nullifying the 'huge discrepancy in physical power and the asymmetry of their international standing'. [...] The mood in the West Bank was euphoric. [...] In diplomatic terms, the significance of Madrid was that it laid down a twin-track framework; one was for bilateral negotiations between Israel and Jordan, Syria and Lebanon; and the other, an Israeli-Palestinian track—a genuinely historic innovation. [...] Neither led anywhere at all for a long time. But both did eventually bring progress, albeit in different and unanticipated ways.
