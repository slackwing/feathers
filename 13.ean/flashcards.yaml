  question: When was Hamas created (or announced) and under what conditions.
  answer: Mid-December 1987. A decade before in 1978, the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood made advances, e.g. founding the Islamic University in Gaza. This group focused on promoting Islam through building mosques, schools, health-care institutions, charitable bodies, and kindergartens, and gained traction (sapping control from the PLO). But the Islamists eventually were indoctrinated 'towards fanatic zeal.' It was from this generation of Islamists that Hamas was founded, initially led by Yassin, who led the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood before.

  answer: The Palestinian Liberation Front hijacked a cruise liner and launched a seaborne raid on Israel, weakening Arafat's (PLO) position, dialogue with US being suspended at the behest of Israel. This would lead to Arafat siding with Baghdad and Saddam Hussein, who offered the most financial support to the PLO by far than other Arab states.

  question: How did Sadaam Hussein's linking of withdrawal of his forces from the emirate to withdrawal of Israel's forces from occupied territories play out?
  answer: It was considered a brilliant move, putting his enemies on the spot. However, pro-Saddam sentiment spread among Palestinians, with 84% of West Bankers considering Saddam a hero, which undermined their image and arguments for peace.

  question: What dramatic and ceremonial event attracted intense media coverage on 31 October 1991?
  answer: The Madrid peace conference; the first of many Madrid talks. "Madrid went a long way toward repairing some of the damage caused by the Gulf war, nullifying the 'huge discrepancy in physical power and the asymmetry of their international standing'. [...] The mood in the West Bank was euphoric. [...] In diplomatic terms, the significance of Madrid was that it laid down a twin-track framework; one was for bilateral negotiations between Israel and Jordan, Syria and Lebanon; and the other, an Israeli-Palestinian track—a genuinely historic innovation. [...] Neither led anywhere at all for a long time. But both did eventually bring progress, albeit in different and unanticipated ways.

  question: What was Norway's involvement?
  answer: Terje Rod-Larsen of the Norwegian Institute for Applied Social Research suggested that Norway, which had good relations with the PLO and was not a member of the European Community, could be a conduit for discreet Israeli-Palestinian contacts. Starting in January 1993, some fourteen meetings took place in Norway, unbeknownst to Washington (whose talks were suspended at that time) for at least 9 months. Yossi Beilin was the Israeli Labor Party politician who architected back-channel ("track-two") diplomacy. Close to him were the two Israeli political scientists who were sent; Yair Hirschfeld and Ron Pundak. Hirschfeld was already close to Faisal Husseini. At the seventh round in Norway, the Israelis introduced the notion of 'mutual recognition' between Israel and the PLO. In September 1993, the Oslo agreement was signed on The White House lawn, with Bill Clinton having to coax Rabin to shake Arafat's hand.

  question: What was the Wye River Memorandum?
  answer: In September 1998 Bill Clinton hosted a summit to continue the Oslo process at Wye River, Maryland. The resulting Wye River Memorandum was signed on 23 October 1998 by Netanyahu and Arafat. It called for further Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank, expanded Palestinian self-rule, and security cooperation. At the end of December, the Palestinian parliament voted to approve a letter to the American president, confirming the nullification of the offensive provisions of the National Charter, which called for the destruction of Israel.

  question: What two attempts at peace failed to materialize in 2000?
  answer: A new Noridic 'backchannel' established in Stockholm failed to emulate the magic of Oslo; and the 15-day 'pressure-cooker' Camp David Summit in July 2000, despite Barak's willingness to make significant concessions, failed due to Arafat's rejection of the proposals. (The concessions; 91% of the West Bank, 100% of Gaza, 1-3% of Israel to compensate for annexations, to form a contiguous Palestinian state; shared Jerusalem; refugees to be settled in the new state or third countries.) (Clarification; From the Palestinian perspective, not truly contiguous, cut by Israelie settlement blocs, dependent on Israeli-controlled roads, subject to Israeli security zones, checkpoints, and overflight.)

  answer: A centrist political party founded by Sharon in November 2005 2 months before he suffered a massive stroke and sank into a coma; the movement was carried to victory by Ehud Olmert in March.
